FOH provides occupational health consultation and services to Federal Agencies.  For over 40 years FOH has assisted Federal managers in preserving, protecting and promoting the health, safety, and well being of their employees. An essential part of the program is the ability to assist federal managers in mitigating physical workplace hazards and stressors such as poor indoor air quality, workplace contamination by pathogens, excessive noise, handling of toxic materials, and work that must be performed in dangerous or unhealthy surroundings such as dust-filled grain elevators. Dealing with these conditions require that FOH be able to obtain fast, reliable reports from certified testing laboratories on the presence of dangerous substances in samples of air, soil, heating/ventilating/air conditioning system contaminants, etc., which FOH has collected from Federal workplaces. One contract laboratory (or laboratories under the management of a single contractor) will provide these analyses for the FOH program nationwide.

CODAR has successfully completed Phase I of the evaluation.

Preliminary testing of radar system:  A formal 2-day test period will be conducted in January/February, 2002 to establish feasibility and preliminary accuracy of UHF Backscatter RiverSonde approach to monitoring surface flow with distance across river.  This field experiment will presumably be done at a site selected by the USGS near Vernalis gaging station in California, where the same site will be used for the subsequent deployment during Spring runoff period.  During the field experiment, the USGS technical staff will also participate to collect ground-truth data in support of CODAR Ocean Sensors evaluating their radar systems.   CODAR will be free to conduct their own further tests at this location before and after the two-day formal test period, to gather data and experience.

A two-month deployment of the same radar system, after modifications to both hardware and software suggested by the findings from the preliminary test periods.  This will be done at a site selected by the USGS, presumably the Vernalis gaging station.

The system will be programmed to run automatically for measuring water surface velocity distribution at the site, recording data throughout the day and nighttime periods.  Near-real-time processing of the data for the site will occur, so that the velocity distribution data can be examined within days of acquisition.  The ultimate goal, of course, is to achieve an on-site real-time data-processing capability.

1.  This procurement is for one solicitation, structured as a Multiple Award Construction Contract (MACC) resulting in the award of three Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) construction contracts.  One of the contracts will be set-aside for a qualified 8(a) firm, provided an acceptable proposal is submitted, price and technical factors considered. The remaining two contracts will be made to the two firms considered to be the Best Value and will be competed UNRESTRICTED.  If sufficient qualified 8(a) firms apply and are considered ?Best Value?, it is possible that more than one contract will be awarded to 8(a) firms.  We will utilize two-step, Source Selection Procedures for this procurement. This method permits evaluation of proposals based on price competition, technical merit and other factors; permits impartial and comprehensive evaluation of offerors'' proposals; permits discussions if necessary; and the use of a trade-off process when it may be in the best interest of the Government to consider award to other than the lowest priced offeror(s) or other than the highest technically rated offeror(s).   The work will primarily consist of General Construction  (NAICS Code Sector 233, 234, 235).  The majority of the work will be concentrated at, but not limited to the following locations: NAS PENSACOLA REGION (including NTTC Corry Station; Saufley Field; NAS Whiting Field) and NAVAL HOSPITAL, PENSACOLA.  Work will also be performed at NAVAL COASTAL SYSTEMS COMMAND, PANAMA CITY, FL; NAVAL RESERVE CENTERS IN FL and AL; and COAST GUARD STATION, MOBILE, AL. 

2.  The total estimated value for all three contracts is $25,000,000 for the base and three option years.  Award will be made to the three responsible proposers whose proposals, conforming to the RFP, will be most advantageous to the Government, resulting in the Best Value, cost or price and other factors considered.  After award of the initial contracts, the three successful offerors will compete for task orders based on either Best Value to the Government or Lowest Price Technically Acceptable.  The awardees will be encouraged to submit technical and price proposals on all future task orders which will ranging in estimated value from $25,000 to $3,000,000.  Lack of participation may result in the Government not exercising the option for extending the contract.  Firms participating in the pre-proposal conferences or subsequent on-site scoping process will not be compensated for their participation.  Proposers are advised that it is definitely possible that award may be made without discussions or any contact concerning the proposals received.  Therefore, each initial offer should contain the offeror?s best terms from price, schedule and technical standpoint.

3.  Phase I of the procurement process is a narrowing phase to approximately five ? seven offerors based on factors that include:  Past Performance, Technical Qualifications, Scheduling, and Small Business subcontracting Effort. Phase I factors relate to the base year and three option year IDIQ contract requirements for general building type projects including administrative, training, dormitory, and community support type facilities, not just the seed project identified in Section 00150 of the RFP.  Only those offerors selected in Phase I will be allowed to proceed into Phase II.  In Phase II, the competitive field will be required to submit additional information on Factor B (Technical) and price proposals for a ?seed? project which has been identified as an Ultraviolet (UV) Disinfection System at the Wastewater Treatment Plant located at NAS Pensacola, FL.  The estimated price range for the seed project is $250,000 - $500,.000.   Firms are expected to participate in the pre-proposal conference.

Area of Interest:  This BAA is intended to solicit ideas and concepts that identify and quantify key technologies, performance, and engineering issues in order to study and evaluate SSGN Power Projection payload options.  Although not specifically planned, entry into an SSGN Power Projection Payload acquisition program in the future may be facilitated by the study results.  Key technical areas and system concepts are expected to include, but not be limited to, mission planning, targeting, fire control, launcher, advanced navigation, flight control, guidance, propulsion, seeker, fuzing, submunition, and warhead technologies.  For the purposes of this BAA, the Power Projection payload option comprises a system in all variations; the dedicated weapon system and the required physical, electrical, and electronic interfaces with the SSGN.

This is a Program Research and Development Announcement (PRDA).  The Air Force Research Laboratory, Munitions Directorate, Advanced Guidance Division (AFRL/MNGS) is interested in receiving technical and cost proposals for development and demonstration of a Wide-Area Search Synthetic Aperture Radar (WASSAR) seeker for autonomous precision-guided munition applications.  The overall WASSAR program objective is to design, develop, test and demonstrate a breadboard SAR seeker to investigate, and further develop the use of high-resolution SAR seeker technology for wide-area search munitions.  Proposals in response to this PRDA must be received no later than 3:00 P.M. CST on 31 Jan 2002, addressed to Air Force Research Laboratory, Munitions Contracting Division, Bldg. 13, 101 W. Eglin Blvd., Suite 337, Eglin AFB FL 32542-6810, Attn.: Ms Dona Dowdy-Merchant (AFRL/MNK).  Proposals submitted after the cut-off date specified herein shall be treated in accordance with FAR 52.215-1(c)(3), "Instructions to Offerors-Competitive Acquisition (May 2001)".  Responders must reference the following number (MNK-PRDA-02-0003). Proposals submitted must be in accordance with this announcement.  Since this is a PRDA, there will be no formal request for proposal or other solicitation regarding this announcement.  Offerors should be alert to any PRDA amendments that may be published.  The Government reserves the right to amend the due date to allow for subsequent submission-of-proposal dates.  If a proposal is selected to satisfy the PRDA objectives as a result of the first submission, subsequent opportunities for proposal submission will not be available. Please be advised that this is the final PRDA. 
B-- REQUIREMENTS:  
(1)  Background: Present-day Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensors are capable of producing high-resolution imagery in adverse weather conditions, and are used heavily in surveillance and reconnaissance.   New and faster processing techniques enable SAR sensors to produce high-resolution, wide field-of-view images at near real-time frame rates, and current radar hardware and supporting electronics can be compactly packaged making SAR sensors attractive for use in munitions seeker applications.  Additionally, SAR sensors can be configured to process in a SAR mode and a Moving Target Indication (MTI) mode, which enables the same sensor to be used for acquiring and tracking stationary and moving mobile/re-locatable targets.  New techniques also provide SAR sensors with the capability of acquiring and classifying moving targets.  
While past SAR seekers were employed against fixed, high-value targets for terminal weapon guidance, the future evolution of SAR seekers is geared toward searching wide areas, classifying mobile/re-locatable targets, and fitting on weapons that are less than six inches in diameter.  Future SAR seekers will be used to search, acquire and classify stationary and moving mobile/re-locatable targets.  This capability will require high resolution SAR as well as innovative signal processing techniques to complete the search and classification role.  Additionally, the future SAR seekers are expected to result in reduced cost and improved performance relative to existing seeker systems and concepts.  Reduced costs will be realized through the use of commercial off-the-shelf components and the use of previously developed hardware and software.  Improved system performance will be realized through increased frame rates, wider area coverage, adverse weather penetration and new techniques for imaging moving targets with SAR seekers.  
AFRL/MN has established Integrating Concepts (ICs) that will serve as the program baseline in terms of the seeker?s performance capability and requirements.  In general, the integrating concepts support a direct attack type mission and a wide-area search and attack type mission.  These missions have different flight profile, operating range, field of view (FOV), area co', 'http://www.eps.gov/spg/USAF/AFMC/AFRLERS/-MNK-PRDA-02-0003/listing.html', '', '', '') RETURNING "fbo_fbomaster"."id"; args=(u'snote', datetime.date(1, 12, 18), 'Department of the Air Force', 'Air Force Materiel Command', 'AFRL - Eglin Research Site', '32542-6810', u'', u'', 'Department of the Air Force, Air Force Materiel Command, AFRL - Eglin Research Site, 101 West Eglin Blvd Suite 337, Eglin AFB, FL, 32542-6810', 'A -- Wide-Area Search Synthetic Aperture Radar (WASSAR) Seeker', u'', None, u'', u'', u'', 'A -- INTRODUCTION: \r\nThis is a Program Research and Development Announcement (PRDA).

CODAR has successfully completed Phase I of the evaluation.

Preliminary testing of radar system:  A formal 2-day test period will be conducted in January/February, 2002 to establish feasibility and preliminary accuracy of UHF Backscatter RiverSonde approach to monitoring surface flow with distance across river.  This field experiment will presumably be done at a site selected by the USGS near Vernalis gaging station in California, where the same site will be used for the subsequent deployment during Spring runoff period.  During the field experiment, the USGS technical staff will also participate to collect ground-truth data in support of CODAR Ocean Sensors evaluating their radar systems.   CODAR will be free to conduct their own further tests at this location before and after the two-day formal test period, to gather data and experience.

A two-month deployment of the same radar system, after modifications to both hardware and software suggested by the findings from the preliminary test periods.  This will be done at a site selected by the USGS, presumably the Vernalis gaging station.  Power and phone lines will be available, as well as some measure of security for the equipment afforded by cognizant locals near the site.  The system will be programmed to run automatically for measuring water surface velocity distribution at the site, recording data throughout the day and nighttime periods.  Near-real-time processing of the data for the site will occur, so that the velocity distribution data can be examined within days of acquisition.  The ultimate goal, of course, is to achieve an on-site real-time data-processing capability.

1.  This procurement is for one solicitation, structured as a Multiple Award Construction Contract (MACC) resulting in the award of three Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) construction contracts.  One of the contracts will be set-aside for a qualified 8(a) firm, provided an acceptable proposal is submitted, price and technical factors considered. The remaining two contracts will be made to the two firms considered to be the Best Value and will be competed UNRESTRICTED.  If sufficient qualified 8(a) firms apply and are considered ?Best Value?, it is possible that more than one contract will be awarded to 8(a) firms.  We will utilize two-step, Source Selection Procedures for this procurement. This method permits evaluation of proposals based on price competition, technical merit and other factors; permits impartial and comprehensive evaluation of offerors'' proposals; permits discussions if necessary; and the use of a trade-off process when it may be in the best interest of the Government to consider award to other than the lowest priced offeror(s) or other than the highest technically rated offeror(s).   The work will primarily consist of General Construction  (NAICS Code Sector 233, 234, 235).  The majority of the work will be concentrated at, but not limited to the following locations: NAS PENSACOLA REGION (including NTTC Corry Station; Saufley Field; NAS Whiting Field) and NAVAL HOSPITAL, PENSACOLA.  Work will also be performed at NAVAL COASTAL SYSTEMS COMMAND, PANAMA CITY, FL; NAVAL RESERVE CENTERS IN FL and AL; and COAST GUARD STATION, MOBILE, AL. 

2.  The total estimated value for all three contracts is $25,000,000 for the base and three option years.  Award will be made to the three responsible proposers whose proposals, conforming to the RFP, will be most advantageous to the Government, resulting in the Best Value, cost or price and other factors considered.  After award of the initial contracts, the three successful offerors will compete for task orders based on either Best Value to the Government or Lowest Price Technically Acceptable.  The awardees will be encouraged to submit technical and price proposals on all future task orders which will ranging in estimated value from $25,000 to $3,000,000.  Lack of participation may result in the Government not exercising the option for extending the contract.  Firms participating in the pre-proposal conferences or subsequent on-site scoping process will not be compensated for their participation.  Proposers are advised that it is definitely possible that award may be made without discussions or any contact concerning the proposals received.  Therefore, each initial offer should contain the offeror?s best terms from price, schedule and technical standpoint.

3.  Phase I of the procurement process is a narrowing phase to approximately five ? seven offerors based on factors that include:  Past Performance, Technical Qualifications, Scheduling, and Small Business subcontracting Effort. Phase I factors relate to the base year and three option year IDIQ contract requirements for general building type projects including administrative, training, dormitory, and community support type facilities, not just the seed project identified in Section 00150 of the RFP.  Only those offerors selected in Phase I will be allowed to proceed into Phase II.  In Phase II, the competitive field will be required to submit additional information on Factor B (Technical) and price proposals for a ?seed? project which has been identified as an Ultraviolet (UV) Disinfection System at the Wastewater Treatment Plant located at NAS Pensacola, FL.  The estimated price range for the seed project is $250,000 - $500,.000.   Firms are expected to participate in the pre-proposal conference.

This BAA should not be construed as a commitment or authorization to incur costs in anticipation of a resultant agreement.  Information provided herein is subject to modification by the Government, and does not bind the Government to award a contract.

Area of Interest:  This BAA is intended to solicit ideas and concepts that identify and quantify key technologies, performance, and engineering issues in order to study and evaluate SSGN Power Projection payload options.  Although not specifically planned, entry into an SSGN Power Projection Payload acquisition program in the future may be facilitated by the study results.  Key technical areas and system concepts are expected to include, but not be limited to, mission planning, targeting, fire control, launcher, advanced navigation, flight control, guidance, propulsion, seeker, fuzing, submunition, and warhead technologies.  For the purposes of this BAA, the Power Projection payload option comprises a system in all variations; the dedicated weapon system and the required physical, electrical, and electronic interfaces with the SSGN.  Submittals may address individual systems or the full spectrum of systems as defined above, although full (end-to-end) system concepts are encouraged.

This is a Program Research and Development Announcement (PRDA).  The Air Force Research Laboratory, Munitions Directorate, Advanced Guidance Division (AFRL/MNGS) is interested in receiving technical and cost proposals for development and demonstration of a Wide-Area Search Synthetic Aperture Radar (WASSAR) seeker for autonomous precision-guided munition applications.  The overall WASSAR program objective is to design, develop, test and demonstrate a breadboard SAR seeker to investigate, and further develop the use of high-resolution SAR seeker technology for wide-area search munitions.  Proposals in response to this PRDA must be received no later than 3:00 P.M. CST on 31 Jan 2002, addressed to Air Force Research Laboratory, Munitions Contracting Division, Bldg. 13, 101 W. Eglin Blvd., Suite 337, Eglin AFB FL 32542-6810, Attn.: Ms Dona Dowdy-Merchant (AFRL/MNK).  Proposals submitted after the cut-off date specified herein shall be treated in accordance with FAR 52.215-1(c)(3), "Instructions to Offerors-Competitive Acquisition (May 2001)".  Responders must reference the following number (MNK-PRDA-02-0003). Proposals submitted must be in accordance with this announcement.  Since this is a PRDA, there will be no formal request for proposal or other solicitation regarding this announcement.  Offerors should be alert to any PRDA amendments that may be published.  The Government reserves the right to amend the due date to allow for subsequent submission-of-proposal dates.  If a proposal is selected to satisfy the PRDA objectives as a result of the first submission, subsequent opportunities for proposal submission will not be available. Please be advised that this is the final PRDA. 
B-- REQUIREMENTS:  
(1)  Background: Present-day Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensors are capable of producing high-resolution imagery in adverse weather conditions, and are used heavily in surveillance and reconnaissance.   New and faster processing techniques enable SAR sensors to produce high-resolution, wide field-of-view images at near real-time frame rates, and current radar hardware and supporting electronics can be compactly packaged making SAR sensors attractive for use in munitions seeker applications.  Additionally, SAR sensors can be configured to process in a SAR mode and a Moving Target Indication (MTI) mode, which enables the same sensor to be used for acquiring and tracking stationary and moving mobile/re-locatable targets.  New techniques also provide SAR sensors with the capability of acquiring and classifying moving targets.  
While past SAR seekers were employed against fixed, high-value targets for terminal weapon guidance, the future evolution of SAR seekers is geared toward searching wide areas, classifying mobile/re-locatable targets, and fitting on weapons that are less than six inches in diameter.  Future SAR seekers will be used to search, acquire and classify stationary and moving mobile/re-locatable targets.  This capability will require high resolution SAR as well as innovative signal processing techniques to complete the search and classification role.  Additionally, the future SAR seekers are expected to result in reduced cost and improved performance relative to existing seeker systems and concepts.  Reduced costs will be realized through the use of commercial off-the-shelf components and the use of previously developed hardware and software.  Improved system performance will be realized through increased frame rates, wider area coverage, adverse weather penetration and new techniques for imaging moving targets with SAR seekers.  
AFRL/MN has established Integrating Concepts (ICs) that will serve as the program baseline in terms of the seeker?s performance capability and requirements.  In general, the integrating concepts support a direct attack type mission and a wide-area search and attack type mission.  These missions have different flight profile, operating range, field of view (FOV), area co', 'http://www.eps.gov/spg/USAF/AFMC/AFRLERS/-MNK-PRDA-02-0003/listing.html', '', '', '') RETURNING "fbo_fbomaster"."id"; args=(u'snote', datetime.date(2001, 12, 18), 'Department of the Air Force', 'Air Force Materiel Command', 'AFRL - Eglin Research Site', '32542-6810', u'', u'', 'Department of the Air Force, Air Force Materiel Command, AFRL - Eglin Research Site, 101 West Eglin Blvd Suite 337, Eglin AFB, FL, 32542-6810', 'A -- Wide-Area Search Synthetic Aperture Radar (WASSAR) Seeker', u'', None, u'', u'', u'', 'A -- INTRODUCTION: \r\nThis is a Program Research and Development Announcement (PRDA).
