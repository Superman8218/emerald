The specific tasking to be accomplished under this SOW is to provide maintenance and support services for the MICRO Super Magnetic Energy Storage (SMES) devices (Units 1 & 2) (ii) Location of Work to Be Performed. DMC Oklahoma City, 8705 Industrial Blvd., Bldg. 3900, Tinker AFB, OK 73145, Technical POC Mike Zeckser, Telephone (405) 739-3024 (iii) Responsibilities of the Contractor. (1)Maintenance Service  The contractor shall support and maintain all hardware components provided under this Contract.  The Contractor shall provide on-call maintenance (remedial and preventive), tools, labor and parts and shall keep the equipment in good operating condition.  The Contractor shall designate an individual(s) as point of contact to respond to calls from the Government for the notification and technical resolution of maintenance problems.  This Point of Contact shall be available during the Principal Period of Maintenance (PPM), which in this case is 0000-2400, seven (7) days per week.  The Contractor, no later than 7 days after contract award date, shall furnish the Government with the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of the Primary and Alternate Point of Contact (2) Period of Performance.  Period of Performance for Maintenance is 24 hrs x 7 days a week, for anticipated contract period 07 Oct 1999 through 06 Oct 2000.  The maintenance charge shall entitle the Government to on-call maintenance with a four hour response 24 hours per day.  (3) Security Clearance.  The contractor shall have "escorted" entry into the SMES enclosures within the maintenance yard for all site visits.  The security office shall be notified prior to these scheduled PM with a "site visit" letter stating the date of visit, the name(s), social security number(s), and security clearance(s) of each involved company representative.  The Contractor shall observe and comply with all security provisions in effect at the facility.  Any required identification badges will be worn and displayed at all times by Contractor personnel.  (iv) Tasks.(1) Preventive Maintenance (PM) shall be performed during the principal period of maintenance.  PM shall include three (3) estimated site visits per unit/enclosure in FY-00 to provide four, eight, and twelve month maintenance activities.  This frequency is based on historical data from field operations, and is largely driven by the health of the helium "liquefier" cold-box.  System performance as predicted from performance monitoring may allow a longer interval than four (4) months between scheduled preventative maintenance.  The performance of the PM shall be scheduled on a mutually agreeable basis as much as possible.  PM shall be performed so as not to interfere with the Government's operation.  Replacement of damaged equipment/media due to Contractor's error or negligence shall be at the Contractor's expense. (2) Remedial Maintenance.

(Refer to paragraph (iii)(1)).  Additional maintenance trips may become necessary for electrical or mechanical equipment repair or adjustment.  This maintenance activity is key to assuring full operational availability.  Scheduling of these activities is based on performance monitoring, customer feedback, or Contractor technician observation during sustaining operation visits, rather than elapsed time.  If a unscheduled repair becomes necessary at a time not coinciding with a scheduled maintenance activity, a scheduled visit to inspect, repair or replace any marginal components would be required to prevent a failure. (3) Performance Monitoring. Performance Monitoring shall be accomplished each day during the workweek, the contractor shall interrogate the a low speed file from the Tinker AFB MSMES units.  From this interrogation, a "STATUS RECORD" shall be maintained to track subsystem health.  Contractor will use this data to predict and schedule any preventative measures, as described above.  As the second part of performance monitoring, the contractor shall collect and analyze high-speed data from carryover events.  Carryover reporting/analysis shall be conducted as soon as possible after receipt of the high-speed file.  Carryover summaries shall be provided to DMC-OKC site.  (v) Responsibilities of the Government. (1) Government personnel shall not perform maintenance or attempt repairs to the system equipment unless such action is agreed to by the Contractor. (2) The Government will permit contractor personnel access to the equipment, subject to security regulations. (3) The Government will provide time for contractor sponsored modifications after being notified by the Contractor.  The time required to make the modification shall be outside the prime system operating hours. (vi) Definitions. (1) "Principal Period of Maintenance" - (PPM) is defined for this action as 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. (2) "Preventive Maintenance" - (PM) is defined as scheduled maintenance on hardware intended to prevent malfunctions from occurring. (3) "Remedial Maintenance" - (RM) is defined as unscheduled maintenance intended to eliminate an existing malfunction.

<DESC>SIC Code 8711,  REPAIR & ALTERATION, Earle Cabell Federal Building/Courthouse, 1100 Commerce Street, and Santa Fe Federal Building, 1114 Commerce Street, Dallas, TX.  Request for Qualifications, Solicitation No. GS-07P-99-UAC-5001.

The General Services Administration announces an opportunity for Architecture, Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, and Project Management.  Architectural-Engineering (A/E) Design Services, optional Construction Phase Services, are required for the design for Repairs and Alterations at the Earle Cabell Federal Building/Courthouse, 1100 Commerce Street, and Santa Fe Federal Building, 1114 Commerce Street, Dallas, TX.  The Cabell Building contains approximately 987,000 gross square feet, spread over 16 floors, including basement and mechanical penthouse.  The Santa Fe Building contains approximately 402,000 gross square feet, spread over 19 floors, including basement and attic.  Floors 11 - 19  (72,000 gsf) in the Santa Fe Building are unoccupied since they do not comply with life safety codes.

The design work for these two buildings will require sensitivity to the complex nature of phased construction in occupied buildings.  The Cabell Building tenants include the U. S. District Court, Northern District of Texas, and a number of Executive Branch agencies.  The Santa Fe Building contains general office space for various federal agencies, including IRS and the Corps of Engineers.  An important additional factor for the designer to take into account is the requirement to repair and clean the exterior wall panels on the Cabell Building, especially because of the need to safeguard the pedestrian-filled sidewalk below the Commerce Street faade.  

The estimated construction cost is between $10 and $15 million with a maximum construction period of 1- years.  Design services for this contract shall not exceed 14 months.  The types of functional areas in these buildings may include, but not be limited to, general office space, computer rooms, courtrooms, judicial chambers, secured and restricted areas, public circulation areas, secured and restricted circulation areas, conference and training areas, facility management, and support areas.  The project scope of work will include: A. Earle Cabell Building - (1) repair and clean exterior closure, (2) replace window film, (3) handicapped accessibility improvements, (4) boiler replacement,  (5) work related to fire sprinkler system, HVAC diffusers, plumbing, energy management system, domestic hot water, and smoke detectors,  (6) replacement of transformers, electrical panels, and breakers, (7) visual fire alarm systems.  B. Santa Fe Building - (1) handicapped accessibility improvements, (2) work related to fire sprinkler system, major HVAC system upgrades, air cooled condensers, energy management system, plumbing, and smoke detectors, (3) replacement of transformers and electrical panels,  (4) overcurrent protection, (5) firefighter telephones and visual fire alarm systems.

The Scope of A-E services under this proposed contract may include, but is not limited to the following: design programming; survey of existing conditions (including site, building and subsurface investigations/surveys); presentations for client and tenant agencies; energy conservation analysis; development of housing plans and support for the relocation of tenants into swing space; complete architectural and engineering design; Value Engineering; Cost Estimating; Space Planning; Interior Design; Acoustic Engineering; test lab services; life safety code compliance; accessibility compliance; construction scheduling, preparation of construction documents (plans and specifications), studies and reports, explanatory drawings, and optional construction phase A-E services (shop drawing and material submittal review, RFI management, supplementary design services, and as-built document preparation).  The design team must have the capability to produce drawings compatible with AutoCadd version 14, narratives and specifications compatible with Microsoft Word Version 7.0a for Windows NT and estimates compatible with Microsoft Excel Version 7.0 for Windows NT.  The Government intends to use the partnering process during the design and construction of this project.

The A-E selection will be based upon a two stage selection process as follows: Stage I selection will result in a short list of at least three firms based on design capabilities, achievements, philosophy for the project by the Design Team, and physical location of the Design Team firms; Stage II will result in a selection of the best qualified A-E firm based on additional written documentation and interviews with the short listed firms regarding the entire project team, project management approach, cost control, schedule control, quality control along with the information submitted under Stage I.

Consideration will be limited to firms, partnerships or joint ventures having an active design production office with the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex area in the State of Texas, which is operation at the time of this announcement.  Consultants are not required to be located within the prescribed area.  A-E firms shall be required to demonstrate during Stage II the capability and intent to perform 50% of the Design and Contract Documentation Services, including project communications and controls within the Dallas/Fort Worth, TX metroplex area.  Consultants may submit with multiple firms.

STAGE I SUBMITTAL: Submit information on modified Standard Forms (SF) 254 & 255 on issues addressing: design capability; achievements; and vision or philosophy, energy conservation, functional appropriateness, cost effectiveness, client satisfaction, and durability/ease of maintenance for this project.  The short list will be developed based on the following Evaluation Criteria Categories:

(1) Capability/Past Performance of Design Team (50 %)  
A.  Submit a description (maximum of two pages, double-spaced, per project) for four to six design projects completed in the past five years.  Photographs that show before or after views of the project can also be submitted.  A minimum of two of the submitted projects shall have been in multi-story buildings (minimum of 8 stories) with total construction costs exceeding $5 million.  The design work for the projects described by the firms responding shall have scopes which clearly demonstrate competence in the mechanical and electrical engineering identified in the scopes for the Cabell and Sante Fe Buildings.

B.   Design work must include the involvement of either in-house or consulting fire protection engineers for at least two of the projects described.

C.  Demonstrate evidence of sophisticated solutions to complex problems (including phased construction in occupied buildings) and how you responded to programmatic requirements and owner constraints (budget and schedule).

D.  Because of the special nature of repairing and cleaning high rise building exteriors, the firm on the Design Team who has performed such projects shall specifically provide the following information on past and current projects: location, building information, date of performance, exact nature of the design work, and references.  If the A-E firm proposes to joint-venture or otherwise team with a consultant who has performed such design work, state whether the firms have worked together before and provide appropriate data (building, location, date, and references).  If the firms have not worked together before, specify the type of contractual relationship proposed.  Note:  Submission of a firm who has designed work for repairing and cleaning multi-story buildings, minimum eight stories, is a mandatory requirement to be included on the short list.

E.  Discuss the salient features of each design and how the design was cost effective, functional, and attractive.  Include name, address and current telephone number for each project owner's point of contact.

     (2) Design Approach/Philosophy   (20%): Provide a narrative statement, not exceeding two typewritten pages, double spaces, describing the design approach, design considerations, philosophy, goals and objectives regarding the proposed project.  This narrative should address design opportunities for this project and how the project requirements and objectives will influence the design.   This submission must be prepared, signed and dated by the Team's designated project manager.  It must also be reviewed, signed and dated by the principals of each participating firm.

    (3) Profiles  (30%): For each architect, engineering, and other key personnel on the Design Team, submit a biographical sketch including professional work experience, education, training, and registration.  Prepare a matrix, which shows for each of the four to six projects, which members profiled worked on which projects.

Stage I submittals (provide 3 copies) for short list selection must be received by the Contracting Officer no later than 2:00 P.M., Monday June 28, 1999, local Fort Worth, TX, time.  For identification purposes, all submittals must clearly indicate the solicitation number and proposal due date and time on the face of the envelope.  Late submittals will be handled in accordance with FAR 15.208 (Submission, modification, revision, and withdrawal of proposals).

A presubmittal meeting for Stage I to discuss project objectives and to answer questions will be held at 10:00 AM on June 10, 1999 in the Earle Cabell Federal Building/ Courthouse, Room 7A1, 1110 Commerce Street, Dallas, TX.  In order to attend, each design firm must contact Teresa Thompson 817/978-7084 at least 3 days prior to the meeting for information and reservations (maximum of three representatives from the Design Team may attend).  Attendance is not mandatory.  Minutes will be made available to all firms attending, as well as those interested but not in attendance. 

STAGE II SUBMITTAL: Firms short-listed for interview will be notified in writing.  The information required in the Stage II submittal will be described in the notification.  The second stage evaluation will require submittal of the SF 254 and SF 255 for the complete design team.  Interviews will be conducted.  At the interview, each key member of the Design Team shall outline his or her relevant experience (maximum 5 minutes).  

A Prospectus Development Study (PDS) defining the major project requirements and objectives has been prepared.   An edited copy of the PDS for the Repairs & Alteration of the Earle Cabell Federal Building/Courthouse and the Santa Fe Federal Building, Dallas, TX will be made available to short listed firms by contacting Howard Bergman, General Services Administration, at 817/978-4677.

During the Stage II interviews, the goals and objectives of the Art-in-Architecture Program will be explained to the prospective A-E firms.  The A-E Evaluation Board will ascertain the level of experience the firms have had with artists as members of a design team and integrating art into architecture.

This procurement is set-aside for small business concerns however large business concerns may be consultants on the design team. 

During the design phase, the Government may elect to incorporate the use of a Construction Management firm to oversee and review the design A/E's work including, but not limited to constructibility, and cost data reviews.  

This is a negotiated procurement that will result in award of a firm-fixed price contract.  Award of this contract is contingent upon receipt of design funds and successful negotiation of a reasonable fee.  This is not a Request for Fee Proposal.  A-E firms will not be reimbursed for expenses or efforts under Stage I and/or Stage II submissions.  For additional information regarding procurement procedures contact Teresa Thompson at 818/978-7084.

<SUBJECT>STUDY OF ADEQUACY OF COMMERCIAL TRUCK PARKING FACILITIES: REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

<DESC>This is a Request for Information. This is not a solicitation, a request for proposals (RFP), or a request for applications (RFA) of federal assistance. Interested parties are invited to submit
comments to Sarah Tarpgaard at the address above. Technical questions should be directed to Robert E. L. Davis, (202) 366-2997, or by electronic mail at Robert.Davis@fhwa.dot.gov. SUMMARY: The Federal Highway Administration_s Office of Motor Carrier & Highway Safety (OMCHS) will conduct research to ascertain where improvements in commercial motor vehicle parking are needed along the National Highway System and identify means to provide more spaces where needed. As part of its planning process for this research, the OMCHS seeks feedback from interested parties about: the appropriate focus of the research study; important tasks to include; information sources to consult; interested participants to contact for input and
feedback; etc. PURPOSE: The OMCHS recognizes that the challenge of providing adequate, safe, off-road parking for commercial motor vehicle operators needing rest has been the province
of State and local officials, as well as private sector operatives, for many decades. The OMCHS also acknowledges that these sources, along with officials from the motor carrier industry and certain safety organizations, offer the most knowledgeable perspective about both the problem and some potentially effective solutions. For this reason, the OMCHS is soliciting feedback through this Request for Information and the forthcoming Rest Area Forum (described below). OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this Request for Information are to (1) obtain feedback on how best to design, focus, and conduct this Congressionally required research into commercial motor vehicle rest parking needs, and (2) based on the feedback, prepare the Request for Proposal that will seek contractual assistance in conducting the study itself. BACKGROUND: Section 4027 of the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA21) requires a study by the Secretary of Transportation to determine the _location and quantity of parking facilities at commercial truck stops and travel plazas and public rest areas that could be use by motor carriers to comply with Federal hours-of-service rules._ Section 4027 calls for three things: a nationwide inventory of rest areas and other parking facilities along the National Highway System; an analysis of shortages, real and projected; and development of a plan to reduce the shortages.  The Section also stipulates that this research is to be conducted in cooperation with research organizations that represent the motor carrier industry, the travel plaza industry, and commercial motor vehicle drivers. This is not the first study by the OMCHS to assess commercial vehicle parking needs. In cooperation with the American Trucking Associations_ Trucking Research Institute (TRI), the OMCHS undertook a study, completed in 1996, that assessed the availability and demand for public rest area and privately owned truck stop parking along the Interstate highway system (not the larger National Highway System called for in the TEA21 study). The Interstate system was chosen for this review, due to(1)its predominant use by commercial vehicle operators engaged in long-haul operations, and(2)indications from earlier reports that the Interstate system was the area in greatest need, especially at night, of safe off-road parking of commercial vehicles. The 1996 study: catalogued information about 1,487 public rest areas along Interstate highways in the Continental U.S.; surveyed drivers, motor carriers, and truck stop operators about parking issues; and projected, based on statistical modeling, some significant shortages in public parking availability. The 1996 research also sought to generate a
weighted sample of available parking at privately owned truck stops across the U.S. While results of the truck stop sample were not conclusive, it projected that privately owned spaces, too, were frequently at a premium. It also noted that planned expansions by many of the truck stop operators did offer the potential for greater parking opportunities. Yet, substitution of
private spaces for public, and vice versa, was not a viable option. A critical survey finding revealed that commercial drivers tend to choose public and private parking for different reasons, and that the two were not necessarily interchangeable. The OMCHS hopes that the work that went into the 1996 study, within reason, could be appropriately applied to the design of the
TEA21 study, so that needless duplication of effort may be avoided. Also, the OMCHS believes that the significant findings from the former study should not be lost in considering the focus of the latter. Therefore, respondents may wish to consider the achievements, and the omissions, of the 1996 study in offering their recommendations for the design and focus of the subject TEA21 study.(Copies of the final report may be obtained electronically at www.eps.gov (Select _EPS for Vendors_ option, then select the _Posted Dates_ link that is to the right of the _DOT_,look for the report as a related document to this RFI posted 5/21/99 entitled _Study of Adequacy of Commercial Truck Parking Facilities: Request for Information_) or from the National
Technical Information Service by calling (703) 605-6000. Ask for final report PB97-124705.) In addition to asking for public feedback on the TEA21 study requirements, the OMCHS has determined that another appropriate step in formulating a study design would be to convene a public meeting of persons actively engaged in solving the parking problem for commercial vehicle operators. Accordingly, on June 29 and 30,1999, in Atlanta, Georgia, the OMCHS will host a Rest Area Forum for State enforcement and department of transportation officials, motor
carriers, private truck stop operators, commercial drivers, safety advocates, and other interested parties. During the Forum, attendees will be asked to:(1)review, with their peers from the
public and private sectors, various issues surrounding the  current provision of parking, by both public and private parties, for commercial drivers to use for resting, particularly at night; (2)describe and document _success stories_ and _best practices_ being employed to alleviate shortages of parking spaces and enhance their safety during day and nighttime hours;(3)consider effective means to provide _real-time_ information to commercial drivers in need of rest about available parking spaces at privately owned truck stops or public rest areas;(4)identify
appropriate actions, initiatives, and pilot efforts that could be undertaken by both public and private sources to expand the number of safe, accessible parking spaces across the United States; and(5)identify any needed legislative initiatives, including the provision of resources, that would be helpful in facilitating the improvement of commercial vehicle parking. Feedback obtained from this Forum will be included with information obtained from respondents to this Request for Information in formulating the future Request for Proposal for the TEA21 research study. For further information of the Forum in Atlanta, contact Dr. Pat Hamilton at (703) 818-7070 or email DrPatHamilton@Erols.com. EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST:  Interested parties are invited to contribute their feedback by including the following in their submissions:(1)Name of organization, address, phone number(s), facsimile number, point(s) of contact, title, and email address;(2)A brief description of the submitting organization; and(3)Any innovative ideas, recommendations, points for consideration, and experiences that the OMCHS should consider in developing the final Request for Proposal for the TEA21 parking study. TIME LINE: Respondents are asked to submit their recommendations for conduct of this important research effort to Sarah Tarpgaard at the above mailing or email address by July 23, 1999.

Dear Tools Vendor:

Six months ago the Hardware and Appliances Center hosted a one-day workshop to talk about the direction the Center was taking.  We shared with everyone that the Center would be moving towards a single contracting method - Multiple Award Schedules (MAS) - to support all of our supply programs.  Many of you are already participating in this exciting method of doing business with the Government.  GSA had radically restructured the MAS program over the past three years.  With these changes there is a stronger emphasis on the use of commercial practices and best value, rather than only on low priced buying.  As a result, the MAS program provides all businesses, especially small and women owned businesses, a low cost entre into a very large Federal Market!

Currently the Center uses three methods of contracting to support various supply programs.  In the future we will use the MAS Contracts to support GSA Stock and Special Order Programs (SOP).  Many of you currently have multiple contracts under these three separate programs!  The elimination of separate stock and special order contracts will reduce your efforts in contracting with GSA and will also enable you to cover virtually your entire product line under one contract.

The Center issued Multiple Award Schedule Solicitation 6FES-980203R3 on the Electronic Posting System (EPS) on January 5, 1999.  This solicitation has merged all of the existing schedules programs for tools, woodworking and metalworking equipment into one schedule, substantially broadened the product line that may be offered, and reduced the number of Special Item Numbers to eight. You may access this solicitation via the Internet under http://www.eps.gov.

It is extremely important that you submit offers under this solicitation as quickly as possible.  Effective December 31, 1999, the Hardware and Appliances Center will not issue separate solicitations for items in the Stock and Special Order Programs.  We will establish Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPA's) against MAS contract requirements for Stock and SOP.  The award will only be made to one firm.

In order to assist any firm interested in participating in the MAS program, we will host a monthly "hands on" seminar at our location here in Kansas City, Missouri.  These workshops will be held the second Tuesday of each month beginning on April 13, 1999.  Please contact Joseph Marvil on (816) 926-7297 or at Internet address http://www.jmarvil@gsa.gov to register for these workshops and to obtain information on times and locations.

During our workshop, we received very positive feedback for this program change.  Over the many years that we have worked together we have had an excellent relationship and have gone through many changes together.  I am confident we will continue to work together in this new endeavor and build even stronger partnerships!

If you have any questions please contact myself on (816) 926-7179 or Mr. Joseph Marvil, Director, Acquisition Division II on (816) 926-7297.   You are also encouraged to visit our home page at http://www.r6.gsa.gov/hac to learn more about this program and other exciting aspects of the Hardware and Appliances Center.

Sincerely,

Larry E. Schroyer
