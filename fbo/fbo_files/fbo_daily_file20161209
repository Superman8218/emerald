<p>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA) TITLE: Knowledge Aided GEOINT Latency Reduction (KAGLR)</p>
<p>BAA ANNOUNCEMENT TYPE: Initial announcement</p>
<p>BAA NUMBER: BAA FA8750-17-S-7004</p>
<p>CATALOG OF FEDERAL DOMESTIC ASSISTANCE (CFDA) Number: 12.800</p>
<p><strong>I. FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:</strong></p>
<p>The Air Force Research Laboratory is soliciting white papers under this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for research, development, integration, test and evaluation of technologies/techniques to provide geospatial intelligence (GEOINT) in all its forms and from whatever source - imagery, imagery intelligence, or geospatial data and information - to ensure a solid foundation of knowledge for planning, decision, and action while creating tailored, customer-specific geospatial intelligence, analytic services, and solutions.</p>
<p>The Department of Defense (DoD) and the Intelligence Community (IC) intend to meet future customer intelligence needs through anticipatory analysis that is both robust and holistic. GEOINT encompasses all aspects of imagery and includes, but is not limited to, data ranging from the ultraviolet through the microwave portions of the electromagnetic spectrum, as well as information derived from the analysis of literal imagery; geospatial data; georeferenced social media; and information technically derived from the processing, exploitation, literal, and non-literal analysis of spectral, spatial, temporal, radiometric, phase history, polarimetric data, fused products, and the ancillary data needed for data processing and exploitation, and signature information (to include development, validation, simulation, data archival, and dissemination). Improving analytic workflows and capabilities, the DoD &amp; IC stakeholders will require the development of new analytic techniques, an environment that can quickly leverage new technologies, and integration of advanced geospatial sensor data to enable more sophisticated analytic products and services. The intent is to take advantage of the full-spectrum of geospatial phenomenologies while leveraging both traditional and non-traditional sources. To take advantage of these emerging capabilities, the GEOINT community needs to evolve analytical tradecraft. Potential solutions must adhere to applicable DoD &amp; IC security &amp; Cyber-related and information assurance directives while addressing enterprise-wide stakeholder requirements specific to GEOINT timeliness, quality, &amp; latency metrics. Executing pioneering collection strategies and developing innovative, full-spectrum capable technologies and services will enable the delivery of cost-efficient, flexible solutions that effectively mitigate intelligence gaps and greatly reduce or eliminate today's latency challenges. The KAGLR BAA seeks significant advances to the DoD-IC, and other government agency's GEOINT-related missions across the following sub-disciplines:</p>
<p>&bull; Full-Spectrum GEOINT (FSG) - FSG is derived from multiple sources and correlated to provide actionable intelligence for mission level decisions. Knowledge-based processing and ontological reasoning are required to correlate FSG sources while assessing risks to operational missions. FSG sources include the following:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; Synthetic Aperture Radar<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; Bi-static Radar processing &amp; extraction<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; Thermal Infrared<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; Multi- and Hyper-Spectral<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; Video<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; Overhead Persistent Infrared techniques<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; Modality Independent Point Clouds<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; GEOINT-derived information correlation - Machine Learning (ML) techniques that reduce latency and improve false alarm rates associated with the GEOINT-derived information correlation, data access, and visualization.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; Multi-peak data production &amp; extraction - Machine Learning (ML) techniques that reduce the latency associated with the generation &amp; co-registration of multi-peak GEOINT data products; ML techniques for autonomous data extraction from multipeak GEOINT data sets; ML techniques to identify and cull redundant data from multiple datasets. <br /><br />Specific technologies of interest that support and/or complement the sub disciplines referenced include the following: Convolution Neural Networks / Neural Networks to support data tagging; auto-categorization to reduce manual analyst-driven tasks; Bayesian network implementations that improve analytic confidence and reduce critical reporting/response timelines; Cloud-based graphic processing unit (GPU) implementations that increase speed and efficiency of automated extraction techniques; and Cloud-based High Performance Computing (HPC) &amp; Artificial Intelligence (AI) acceleration technologies to improve the speed and accuracy of image recognition applications &amp; techniques.<br /><br />In the development of solutions, consideration must be given to cyber-security and information assurance. Information Systems need to be developed with security and security interfaces so that the application of various security practices are transparent to the user, ensuring efficient system use with a high level of security. Additionally, with the Intelligence Community's transition to the Intelligence Community Information Technology Enterprise (IC ITE), additional consideration must be given to Assured Cloud Computing. Security risks related to the technologies, software and systems under development and the eventual deployment environment should be considered. As a cloud environment relies heavily on distributed assets, it is necessary to develop approaches to fulfill the 3 pillars of the CIA triad (confidentiality, integrity, availability). Investigate assured computing architectures and associated technologies that will address the mission shortfalls of the DoD and non-DoD information communities.<br /><br />The KAGLR BAA technologies supporting the sub-disciplines above may require the planning and conducting of field tests to demonstrate the advancement in the specific technology. This includes preparing test plans; acquiring, transporting, deploying, and operating all equipment; operating and measuring ground truth sources; evaluating and monitoring test execution; and documenting all test results.<br /><br />The innovative technologies, applications and techniques being pursued under the KAGLR BAA will address significant shortfalls in GEOINT production, reporting, and dissemination choke points which span the Department of Defense and Intelligence Community. Candidate technologies will be evaluated against current requirements for latency, quality, quantity/throughput, and scalability/affordability and will be nominated for transition where appropriate. <br /><br /><strong>II. AWARD INFORMATION:</strong></p>
<p>1. FUNDING: Total funding for this BAA is approximately $49.9M. The anticipated funding to be obligated under this BAA is broken out by fiscal year as follows:</p>

Security classification guidance in the form of a DD Form 254 (DoD Contract Security Classification Specification) will not be provided at this time since AFRL is soliciting ideas only. Offerors that intend to include classified information or data in their white paper submission or who are unsure about the appropriate classification of their white papers should contact the technical point of contact listed in Section VII for guidance and direction in advance of preparation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. MAILING INSTRUCTIONS.</p>
<p>Any mailed responses, unclassified/classified, to this announcement must be sent U.S. Postal Service, registered mail or similar service and addressed to AFRL/RIGC, 525 Brooks Road, Rome NY 13441-4505, and reference BAA FA8750-17-S-7004.</p>

<p>4. OTHER SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS/CONSIDERATIONS:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. COST SHARING OR MATCHING: Cost sharing is not a requirement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. SYSTEM FOR AWARD MANAGEMENT (SAM). Offerors must be registered in the SAM database to receive a contract award, and remain registered during performance and through final payment of any contract or agreement. Processing time for registration in SAM, which normally takes forty-eight hours, should be taken into consideration when registering. Offerors who are not already registered should consider applying for registration before submitting a proposal. The provision at FAR 52.204-7, System for Award Management (Jul 2013) applies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION AND FIRST-TIER SUBCONTRACT/ SUBRECIPIENT AWARDS: Any contract award resulting from this announcement may contain the clause at FAR 52.204-10 - Reporting Executive Compensation and First-Tier Subcontract Awards (Oct 2015). Any grant or agreement award resulting from this announcement may contain the award term set forth in 2 CFR, Appendix A to Part 25 which can be viewed at: <a href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=8fb6c83606df57968c3e7e145e7d683c&amp;mc=true&amp;node=ap2.1.25_1360.a&amp;rgn=div9">http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=8fb6c83606df57968c3e7e145e7d683c&amp;mc=true&amp;node=ap2.1.25_1360.a&amp;rgn=<br />div9</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d. ALLOWABLE CHARGES: The cost of preparing white papers/proposals in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract, but may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost specified in FAR 31.205-18. Incurring pre-award costs for ASSISTANCE INSTRUMENTS ONLY are regulated by the DoD Grant and Agreements Regulations (DODGARS).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e. GOVERNMENT APPROVED ACCOUNTING SYSTEM: An offeror must have a <strong>government approved</strong> accounting system prior to award of a cost-reimbursement contract per limitations set forth in FAR 16.301-3(a) to ensure the system is adequate for determining costs applicable to the contract. The acceptability of an accounting system is determined based upon an audit performed by the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA). <strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> If you do not have a DCAA approved accounting system access the following link for instructions: <a href="https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=1cffad228f48b58057072a6c9113799d&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=1">https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=1cffad228f48b58057072a6c9113799d&amp;tab=<br />core&amp;_cview=1</a></p>
<p><strong>V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:</strong></p>
<p>1. CRITERIA: The following criteria, which are listed in descending order of importance and will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong> a. Overall Scientific and Technical Merit - The extent to which the offeror demonstrates the detailed approach, development, and testing of the proposed new technology to achieve relevant new capabilities or enhancements <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Related Experience - The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology and domain knowledge <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Openness, Maturity and Assurance of Solution -The extent to which existing capabilities and standards are leveraged and the relative maturity of the proposed technology, and <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d. Reasonableness and Realism of Proposed Costs and Fees (if any) </strong></p>
<p>No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.</p>
<p>2. REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS: Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection. The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, and comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.</p>
<p>3. ADEQUATE PRICE COMPETITION: The Government may simultaneously evaluate proposals received under this BAA with a common cutoff date for multiple offerors. In this case, the Government may make award based on adequate price competition, and offerors must be aware that there is a possibility of non-selection due to a proposal of similar but higher-priced technical approach as compared to another offeror.</p>
<p>4. FEDERAL AWARDEE PERFORMANCE AND INTEGRITY INFORMATION SYSTEM (FAPIIS) PUBLIC ACCESS: As required by 2 CFR 200 of the Uniform Guidance and FAR 9.104-6, the Government is required to review and consider any information about the applicant that is in the FAPIIS before making any award in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold (currently $150,000) over the period of performance. An applicant may review and comment on any information about itself that a federal awarding agency previously entered. The Government will consider any comments by the applicant, in addition to other information in FAPIIS in making a judgment about the applicant's integrity, business ethics, and record of performance under federal awards when completing the review of risk posed by applicants as described in 2 CFR &sect; 200.205 Federal Awarding Agency Review of Risk Posed by Applicants and FAR 9.104-6.</p>
<p><strong>VI. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">STEP TWO</span> INFORMATION - REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL &amp; AWARD:</strong></p>
<p>1. AWARD NOTICES: Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the TPOC. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.</p>
<p>For additional information, a copy of the AFRL "Broad Agency Announcement (BAA): Guide for Industry," Mar 2015, and Proposal Preparation Instructions, Dec 2014, may be accessed at: <a href="https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=1cffad228f48b58057072a6c9113799d&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=1">https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=1cffad228f48b58057072a6c9113799d&amp;tab=<br />core&amp;_cview=1</a>. Always reference the newest versions of these documents.</p>
<p>2. ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a Confidential, SECRET or TOP SECRET facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to SECRET or TOP SECRET information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA.</p>
<p>This acquisition may involve data that is subject to export control laws and regulations. Only contractors who are registered and certified with the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS) at <a href="http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/">http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/</a> and have a legitimate business purpose may participate in this solicitation. For questions, contact DLIS on-line at <a href="http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp">http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp</a> or at the DLA Logistics Information Service, 74 Washington Avenue North, Battle Creek, Michigan 49037-3084, and telephone number 1-800-352-3572. You must submit a copy of your approved DD Form 2345, Militarily Critical Technical Data Agreement, with your white paper/proposal.</p>
<p>3. DATA RIGHTS:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. SBIR RIGHTS. The potential for inclusion of Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) or data rights other than unlimited on awards is recognized. In accordance with (IAW) the Small Business Administration (SBA) SBIR Policy Directive, Section 8(b), SBIR data rights clauses are non-negotiable and must not be the subject of negotiations pertaining to an award, or diminished or removed during award administration. Issuance of an award will not be made conditional based on forfeit of data rights. If the SBIR awardee wishes to transfer its SBIR data rights to the Air Force or to a third party, it must do so in writing under a separate agreement. A decision by the awardee to relinquish, transfer, or modify in any way its SBIR data rights must be made without pressure or coercion by the agency or any other party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. NON-SBIR RIGHTS. Non-SBIR data rights less than unlimited will be evaluated and negotiated on a case-by-case basis. Government Purpose Rights are anticipated for data developed with DoD-reimbursed Independent Research and Development (IR&amp;D) funding.</p>
<p>4. REPORTING: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Contract Applicable: Once a proposal has been selected for award, offerors will be given complete instructions on the submission process for the reports. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. FAPIIS Applicable: As required by 2 CFR 200 Appendix XII of the Uniform Guidance and FAR 9.104-6, non-federal entities (NFEs) are required to disclose in FAPIIS any information about criminal, civil, and administrative proceedings, and/or affirm that there is no new information to provide. This applies to NFEs that receive federal awards (currently active grants, cooperative agreements, and procurement contracts) greater than $10,000,000 for any period of time during the period of performance of an award/project.</p>
<p>5. NOTICE: The following provisions* apply:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a) FAR 52.209-11, Representation by Corporations Regarding Delinquent Tax Liability or a Felony Conviction under any Federal Law <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b) DFARS 252.239-7017, Notice of Supply Chain Risk <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (c) DFARS 252.204-7008, Compliance with Safeguarding Covered Defense Information Controls <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (d) DFARS 252.203-7996, Prohibition on Contracting with Entities that Requirement Certain Internal Confidentiality Agreements-Representation<br /><br />* Please note that the current versions or deviations of the related clauses will be included in any resulting contract.</p>
<p>6. <strong>GRANT AWARDS ONLY</strong>: For efforts proposed as grant awards, offerors must provide an abstract in their proposal (not to exceed one page) that is publically releasable and that describes - in terms the public may understand - the project or program supported by the grant. If the proposal is selected for award, the DoD will publically post the abstract to comply with Section 8123 of the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2015 (Pub. L. 113-235).</p>

<ARCHDATE>12232016
<CONTACT>Ashley S. Loper, Senior Subcontract Administrator, Phone 5104864844, Email asloper@lbl.gov
<DESC>To Whom it May Concern:
<p>The University of California, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory ("University" or "LBNL") is seeking information on how an interested party would conduct a joint-evaluation of the Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE)'s Cleantech University Prize (Cleantech UP) and Solar Decathlon programs.</p>
<p>This Request for Information (RFI) seeks responses from parties interested in conducting evaluations of the EERE's Cleantech UP and Solar Decathlon programs ; it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future.</p>
<p>LBNL intends to evaluate the submitted information to determine a list pre-qualified suppliers deemed most qualified from among the responses received.  Those deemed most qualified may be invited to submit a proposal in response to an RFP.</p>
<p>1.0	Overview of the Programs to be Evaluated</p>
<p>1.1	Cleantech University Prize Program (Cleantech UP)<br />The Cleantech UP Program  consists of a series of regional university student competitions. Students apply and compete in each region to present their business plans supporting clean energy innovations. The top students from each region are then selected to compete in a national competition. Cleantech UP was designed with the broad aim of marshaling early-stage venture development through entrepreneurship principles and student business plan competitions. Cleantech UP seeks to increase student participation in clean energy entrepreneurship, and to facilitate learning for innovators before and during the early stages of startup company formation.</p>
<p>In preparation to participate in the competitions, students receive mentorship and training, enhancing their entrepreneurial skills and preparing them to launch technologies from their research universities and into the market. The regional and national competitions award cash and in-kind prizes, and provide opportunities for students to develop the business and commercialization skills to move clean energy technologies from discovery to market.</p>
<p>The program's stated goals are to: <br />1.	Catalyze clean energy start-up formation on college campuses ; <br />2.	Support novel training and educational opportunities that equip the next generation of energy entrepreneurs and innovators across the country;<br />3.	Establish a national-level training program and competition for America's top clean energy student entrepreneurs; and<br />4.	Create a sustained and diverse community to support student entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>The Cleantech UP program evolved from a previous initiative - the National Clean Energy Business Plan Competition (NCEBPC). Similar to Cleantech UP, the NCEBPC was a series of regional student business plan competitions across the country, culminating in a national competition. The NCEBPC was held annually in 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015, attracting over 1,000 applicants. Cleantech UP had its first national competition in 2016, and will continue with regional and national competitions in 2017 and in 2018.</p>
<p>DOE currently funds organizations to run Cleantech UP Regional Competitions across the United States. Each Cleantech UP Regional Competition supports the earliest development of individual students and teams and their training. Organizations that run the Cleantech UP Regional Competitions each: <br />&bull;	Run regional competitions annually, including recruiting applicants, mentors, evaluators, judges, and other competition partners; developing a prize competition structure; developing and executing an outreach and marketing plan; promoting the event; and collecting metrics; and <br />&bull;	Award up to $50,000 in cash prizes from DOE along with in-kind and cash awards and services from third parties.</p>
<p>New under Cleantech UP, DOE established a national hub to run the national competition and serve as a central source of student-focused clean energy entrepreneurship training and education. (Previously under NCEBPC, the national competition was run by DOE). The Cleantech UP National Hub is charged with:<br />&bull;	Developing and delivering a premier clean energy entrepreneurship training program, including instruction in commercialization and preparation for the Cleantech UP National Competition and online curriculum for students interested in exploring clean technology entrepreneurship; <br />&bull;	Strengthening and expanding the clean energy student entrepreneurship community;<br />&bull;	Facilitating a learning platform for the Cleantech UP network to share best practices in clean energy entrepreneurship education and regional competition planning and execution; and<br />&bull;	Organizing an annual National Competition-the culmination of the regional Cleantech UP Competitions-and awarding $100,000 in cash prizes from DOE along with in-kind awards and services from DOE and other sponsors.</p>
<p>There will be seven cohorts for the period 2011 to 2018, corresponding to the competition years. A cohort is comprised of teams of university students who participate in a regional competition in a given competition performance period.  Planning begins in June of the prior year, leading up to regional competitions held between February to May, and a national competition in May or June. Thus, the performance period for each competition bridges two calendar years. The cohorts from 2011 to 2015 participated under NCEBPC, while the cohorts from 2015 to 2018 are participating under Cleantech UP. Given the similar structure and goals of the two programs, this evaluation is intended to cover both, with Cleantech UP treated as a continuation of NCEBPC.</p>
<p>1.1.1	Objective of Evaluation<br />The primary objective of the evaluation will be to determine the impacts of the NCEBPC and Cleantech UP programs, taken together.  A secondary objective of the impact assessment will be to determine the impact of the NCEBPC relative to Cleantech UP. The evaluation will include an impact and process component. Examples of impact metrics of interest to DOE include:<br />&bull;	Students' knowledge gained in business, commercialization and entrepreneurship <br />&bull;	Early / mid-career choices leading to a job in the clean energy industry<br />&bull;	New ventures formed / alumni startup of clean-energy business<br />&bull;	Preparedness for clean energy work<br />&bull;	Patents and intellectual property filed, including patents awarded<br />&bull;	Technology commercialized<br />&bull;	Value of skills (e.g., salary, adaptability and transference of skills, etc.)</p>
<p>Some examples of impact evaluation questions to be covered include:<br />A.	What is the impact of NCEBPC and Cleantech UP on individual student participants and teams compared to non-participants on each of the outcomes of interest?<br />B.	What is the impact of the prize money? How is it used, and does the way it was used have an effect on the success of the startup?<br />C.	How many participating teams are currently still operating?</p>
<p>The process component of the assessment will delve into Cleantech UP's implementation, to assess what is working or not working well, and generate appropriate lessons to inform program improvement. It will also explore reasons why there might be differences in participant outcomes (if any) between the NCEBPC cohorts and the Cleantech UP cohorts.</p>
<p>Some examples of process evaluation questions to be covered include:<br />A.	Are there significant differences between the cohorts from the NCEBPC program compared to the cohorts from the Cleantech UP program in the achievement of outcomes?<br />B.	What changes in programmatic factors associated with the two programs explain observed differences in outcomes?</p>
<p>It is expected that data gathering for these assessments will be performed in three separate years: 2017, 2018 and 2019. Data collected in 2017 will be reported on in 2018. Data collected in subsequent years would be used to update the original report, to establish the progression of outcomes.</p>
<p>1.2	Solar Decathlon Program <br />The Solar Decathlon  challenges teams of college students to design, build, and operate solar powered houses that are cost-effective, energy-efficient, and attractive, and then demonstrate them to the public. The first Solar Decathlon was held in 2002, and has occurred biennially since 2005. The winner of the competition is the team that receives the highest score on ten competition criteria, including architecture, engineering, innovation, health and comfort and market potential.  The objectives of the Solar Decathlon Program are to:<br />&bull;	Demonstrate to the public the opportunities presented by innovatively designed, energy-efficient and solar powered houses; <br />&bull;	Educate student participants and the public about clean energy; and <br />&bull;	Provide participating students with unique training that prepares them to enter the nation's clean-energy workforce.</p>
<p>1.2.1	Objective of Evaluation<br />The primary objective of the impact evaluation will be to assess student-centered impacts. It will exclude any assessment of impacts on homeowners, business and other partners, and the DOE Research and Development (R&amp;D) community. The impact evaluation will cover Decathletes who participated starting from 2002 through 2019. The study will also include a limited process component focused on lessons to be learned from the new management and implementation approach beginning with the 2017 Solar Decathlon. Examples of the student-focused outcomes for the Solar Decathlon of interest to DOE include:<br />&bull;	Knowledge gains<br />&bull;	Preparedness for clean energy work<br />&bull;	Clean energy jobs<br />&bull;	Value of skills (e.g., salary, adaptability and transference of skills, etc.)<br />&bull;	Early / mid-career choices<br />&bull;	Alumni start-ups of clean energy business</p>
<p>Some example evaluation questions include:<br />A.	What is the impact of the Solar Decathlon on Decathletes compared to non-Decathletes, on each of the metrics of interest?<br />B.	Are there significant differences between the 2017 Decathletes and 2015 Decathletes in the achievement of outcomes?<br />C.	What factors from the changes implemented in the 2017 Solar Decathlon approach explain observed outcomes? What lessons are to be gleaned from the new approach?</p>
<p>As with the Cleantech UP evaluation, it is expected that data gathering for the Solar Decathlon assessment will be performed in three separate years: 2017, 2018 and 2019. Data collected in 2017 will be reported on in 2018. Data collected in subsequent years would be used to update the original report, to establish the progression of outcomes. The process component of the assessment will delve into the post-2015 implementation. The 2017 Decathlon was contracted out to new management, with some changes in how the competition is now implemented. The programs are being evaluated jointly because they share similar characteristics and outcomes.</p>

<DESC>INTRODUCTION<br />THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION NON-COMPETITIVE (NOTICE OF INTENT) SYNOPSIS TO AWARD A CONTRACT OR PURCHASE ORDER WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION (INCLUDING BRAND-NAME).
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), Clinical Center (CC); Office of Purchasing and Contracts (OPC), on behalf of the CC Health Information Management Department (HIMD), intends to solicit and negotiate on a sole source basis and award a contract for interface modification services, software customization, and licenses to the 3M Health Information Systems.  The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (1.)</p>
<p>NORTH AMERICAN INDUSTRY CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (NAICS) CODE<br />The intended procurement is classified under NAICS code 541511 with a Size Standard of $27.5 million.<br />REGULATORY AUTHORITY <br />This acquisition is conducted under the procedures as prescribed in FAR subpart 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures at an amount not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold ($150,000).<br />STATUTORY AUTHORITY <br />This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures, Subpart 13.106-1 (b) (1), Soliciting from a single source and is not expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. Contracts awarded using FAR Part 13-Simplifeid Acquisition Procedures are exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6-Competition Requirements. <br />There are no other known sources that could provide this interface and the software licenses without a complete overhaul of the system.<br />GENERAL INFORMATION<br />1. Title: ChartLinc Upload and ViewLinc Image Management System Integration and licenses<br />2. Background Information: The HIMD is responsible for providing timely, accurate and complete health iInformation management for clinical and research purposes for institutes of the NIH and departments of the NIH CC.  Currently the HIMD maintains all Health Information Managements for Clinical Center patients where the clinical documentation is manually filed and provided to researchers and clinicians.<br />The HIMD currently utilizes 3M's ChartLinc to provide interface capability between the CC Hospital Information System (CRIS) and other HIMD- related applications.  These interfaces have been established for many years and allow patient demographics, admission data, and medical orders to flow from the CRIS to the transcription management and incomplete record tracking systems for generation of medical reports and tracking of incomplete Health Information Managements.  These established interfaces also enable diagnostic reports to flow back to the CRIS for viewing by clinicians throughout the CC and enable clinicians to electronically review, edit and sign dictated reports. The current 3M ChartView application in use in the CC allows end users to view scanned paper records. To facilitate the move to a more paperless environment, there is a greater need to scan existing paper documents and have them available to the CRIS user population.  3M's ViewLinc provides the intermediary software between our existing ChartView and ChartLinc applications that allows these advances in health information management practice to take place, along with providing an enhanced quality review process that would enhance methodologies already in place.</p>
<p>3. Purpose or Objective: The purpose of this purchase order is to provide the HIMD with interface modification services and licenses to the department's existing 3M ChartLinc Interface module and ViewLinc Integration.  The 3M Interface approach will accomplish the following:</p>
<p>1.	Assess and confirm the need for an Interface modification, determine the need for custom programming, and identify any outstanding issues or other project/product dependencies at the site that may impact the customization project.<br />2.	Develop site-specific customization software.<br />3.	Test the site customization software.<br />4.	Provide technical support to the site during execution of the customizations in both the Test and Live systems.<br />5.	Provide additional licenses so that end users can utilize the ChartScan software, which is a critical need do to the digitizing of all medical records.</p>
<p>4. Period of Performance: <br />Base year: December 31, 2016 through December 30, 2017<br />Option year 1: December 31, 2017 through December 30, 2018<br />Option year 2: December 31, 2018 through December 30, 2019<br />Option year 3: December 31, 2019 through December 30, 2020</p>

A sources sought notice was posted on 8 November 2016 under synopsis N40085-17-R-0309 to determine availability and capability of small businesses to perform the requirement.  Based on market research results, the procurement will be solicited on an unrestricted basis with full and open competition. NAVFAC Mid-Atlantics Office of Small Business Programs concurs with the determination to solicit as an unrestricted procurement.

Project Description:

This project will repair and upgrade Bachelor Enlisted Quarters (BEQ) Building 3606 by eliminating all Q4 Condition and/or Configuration ratings to bring these facilities up to a Q1 rating to comply with the Defense Planning Guidance.
  All major building systems are substandard and need replacement.  Facility repairs will meet current code requirements and correct existing deficiencies.  Room layouts will be reconfigured to provide two separate baths and service areas (2+0 concept) in lieu of one shared bath for two rooms; remove and replace two closets to fit the reconfigured space.  This project will inspect, replace or repair the existing sanitary waste drain lines in the laundry room in building 3606A.  All existing sanitary sewer piping in 3606 will be replaced.  Electrical breaker panels will be replaced as required to handle the electrical load.  The existing 3606 building ventilation system and ducts will be replaced.
  The facility will be brought up to all Antiterrorism /Force Protection (ATFP) standards in accordance with Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC) 4-010-01 including progressive collapse.  The exterior walls of the buildings will be power washed and a mold growth inhibitor paint applied.  All emergency lighting and exit signs will be replaced with energy efficient stainless steel fixtures with a protective metal cage placed around them to prevent vandalism.  Additional video security cameras will be provided to for security coverage to all blind areas and the existing security monitoring system will be upgraded as required to handle the cameras.  The existing trash dumpster enclosures will be replaced with higher side walls and lockable gates.
  The deteriorated elevators will be replaced and security cameras will be provided.  The current fire alarm and detection system does not meet current standards and must be replaced to bring these buildings in compliance with current life safety codes and UFC-3-600-01.  Properly sized natural gas potable hot water boilers will be provided in 3606B to supply the domestic hot water requirements of 3606 and 3606A.  Landscaping site improvements will be incorporated in this project.
The project replaces the existing 2-pipe heating and cooling system in buildings 3606 and 3606A and provides temporary heating and cooling for building 3609 until a project for building 3609 is programmed.  The heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system and direct digital controls (DDC) used should be the most energy efficient system possible, but natural gas was used for planning and estimating purposes.
  Alternative types of energy efficient HVAC systems will be taken into consideration with the goal to meet the reduced energy consumption mandates.

Building 3606 is a five-story, 91,000 SF BEQ built in 1989 and building 3606A is a 7,680 SF BEQ support building built in 1989.  The scope of work includes replacing the mechanical system in building 3606B for buildings 3606 and 3606A.  These buildings are constructed so that the mechanical systems are interconnected.  This project will remove this interconnection so as to provide each building with an independent mechanical system.  This will allow isolation of each in case of an outage or necessary repairs.  The work also includes all incidental work to make the HVAC system functional.
  All facilities will include cybersecurity commissioning for infrastructure systems such as Direct Digital (DDC) controls, fire alarm and detection and security monitoring systems.

This project will install a complete and useable fire sprinkler system and a roof replacement in building 3606B.

The estimated construction cost is between $25,000,000 and $100,000,000.  

The anticipated award of this contract is June 2017.

The completion time for this contract is 572 calendar days after award.

The specifications for this project will be posted with the solicitation and are not available at this time.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this project is 236220, Commercial and Institutional Building Construction, with a small business size standard of $36.5 million.

<RESPDATE>122316
<CONTACT>William Justin Kidwell, Lease Contracting Officer, Phone 404-562-5033, Email justin.kidwell@gsa.gov
<DESC>The U.S. Government currently occupies office and related space in a building under lease in Birmingham, AL, that will be expiring.
<p>The Government requires office and related space yielding a minimum/maximum of 24,071 ANSI/BOMA Office Area (ABOA) square feet.</p>
<p>The lease term requirement is two (2) years. The space must be available for occupancy immediately. The delineated area is detailed as follows:</p>
<p>Central Business District of Birmingham, AL as shown and detailed in the attached boundary map and narrative.</p>
<p>Other applicable requirements include the following features:</p>
<p>- Ease of access to and availability of parking for visitors and government owned vehicles.<br />- Space must have potential for an efficient layout. Ideal space would be contiguous and on no more than two levels.<br />- Space should be located in a professional office setting.</p>
<p>Offered space must meet Government requirements for fire safety, accessibility, seismic, and sustainability standards per the terms of the lease. The proposed leased space shall be fully serviced. Offered space shall not be in the 100-year flood plain. Subleases are not acceptable.</p>
<p>The Government is considering alternative space if economically advantageous. In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.</p>
<p>Interested parties should send expressions of interest to:</p>
<p>W. Justin Kidwell, Lease Contracting Officer<br />U.S. General Services Administration<br />77 Forsyth Street SW<br />Atlanta, GA 30303</p>
<p>justin.kidwell@gsa.gov</p>
<p>(404) 562-5033: O<br />(404) 803-3137: C</p>
<p>Expressions of interest should be submitted to the above address (physical or email) by 5:00 PM ET on December 23, 2016 and must include the following information:</p>
<p>- Building name and address and location of the available space within the building.<br />- Rentable square feet available and expected rental rate per rentable square foot, fully serviced.<br />- ANSI/BOMA Office Area (ABOA) square feet to be offered and expected rental rate per ABOA square foot, fully serviced. Indicate whether the quoted rental rate includes an amount for tenant improvements and state the amount, if any.<br />- Date of space availability.<br />- Building ownership information.<br />- Amount of parking available on-site and its cost. Include whether expected rental rate includes the cost of the required Government parking, if any.<br />- Energy efficiency and renewable energy features existing within the building.<br />- List of building services provided.</p>
<p>The Government's decision regarding whether to relocate will be based, in part, on information received in response to this advertisement.</p>

      The Department of Veterans Affairs has need for a general construction contractor to provide all labor, materials, and equipment as necessary to expand a new parking structure on the north side of the Washington, DC Medical Center, Main campus located in lot 2A.

The existing structure levels B2, B1, and Ground provides approximately 327 parking spaces. Additional levels (2nd, 3rd, 4th ) on top of the existing (B2, B1, Ground) parking structure will further consolidates surface parking to the existing structure and as a result will limit the level of overall traffic circulating deeper within the medical center campus.

The Expand Visitor/ Patient Parking Garage Phase 1 project vertical expansion shall add approximately 310 parking spaces including the appropriate number of additional accessible spaces required by the latest VA guidelines.

SECURITY CLAUSE: 
The Contractor will protect government property from theft, destruction, or misuse.  The Contractor is required to follow VA directives and handbooks on handling Federal Government IT equipment, information, and systems.  The contractor will not take VA sensitive information from the workplace without authorization from the Contracting Officer.

The Contractor must work with the VA to help protect veteran s personal identifiable information (PII).  With this in mind, no MFC leased under this contract will be allowed to depart the VA Regional Office (VARO) unless  Sanitized  to the satisfaction of the VARO Staff and Contracting Officer.
Sanitization of Election Media:
To protect veteran s personal identifiable information (PII), electronic media, which is to be removed from a VA space, must be sanitized in accordance with NIST SP800-88 to protect sensitive information.

POLICY:
Election media must be sanitized and/or destroyed in accordance with NIST SP800-88 specifications.
No device covered in this SOP may leave VA space without ensuring that the hard drive has been sanitized and cleared of all personal identifying information (PII) in accordance with NIST SP800-88.
Applicable NIST SP800-88 specifications:
Sanitization Methods (NIST Special Publication 800-88; Table 5-1)
Method Description

Clear One method to sanitize media is to use software or hardware products to
 overwrite storage space on the media with non-sensitive data.  This process
 may include overwriting not only the logical storage location of a file(s) (e.g.,
 file allocation table) but also may include all addressable locations.  The
 security goal of the overwriting process is to replace written data with random
 data.  Overwriting cannot be used for media that are damaged or not rewriteable.
 The media type and size may also influence whether overwriting is a suitable
 sanitization method [SP 800-36].

Purge Degaussing and executing the firmware Secure Erase command (for ATA
 drives only) are acceptable methods for purging.

 Degaussing is exposing the magnetic media to a strong magnetic field in order
 to disrupt the recorded magnetic domains.  A degausser is a device that generates
 a magnetic field used to sanitize magnetic media.  Degausser's are rated based on
 the type (i.e., low energy or high energy) of magnetic media they can purge. 
 Degaussers operate using either a strong permanent magnet or an electromagnetic
 coil.  Degaussing can be an effective method for purging damaged or inoperative 
 media, for purging media with exceptionally large storage capacities, or for quick
 purging diskettes. [SP 800-36]

DestroyThere are many different types, techniques, and procedures for media destruction.
 If destruction is decided on because of the high security categorization of the 
 information, then after the destruction, the media should be able to withstand a 
 a laboratory attack.

Disintegration, Pulverization, Melting, and Incineration.  These
sanitization methods are designed to completely destroy the 
media.  They are typically carried out at an outsourced metal
destruction or licensed incineration facility with the specific
capabilities to perform these activities effectively, securely, and
safely.

Shredding. Paper shredders can be used to destroy flexible media
Such as diskettes once the media are physically removed from their
outer containers.  The shred size of the refuse should be small enough
that there is reasonable assurance in proportion to the data confidentiality
that the data cannot be reconstructed.
 
 
Optical mass storage media, including compact disk (CD, CD-RW, CD-R, CD-ROM), 
 optical disks (DVD), and MO disks, must be destroyed by pulverizing, crosscut shredding 
 or burning.  When material is disintegrated or shredded all residues must be reduced to 
 nominal edge dimensions of five millimeters (5 mm) and surface area of twenty-five square
 millimeters )25 mm2).

Media Sanitization Decision Matrix (NIST Special Publication 800-88; Table A-1)

Media Type Clear    Purge  Physical Destruction

  ** Please contact the              Incinerate. Incinerate

                  incinerator.
 NOTE: If the chosen sanitization method is to perform a full manufacturer s reset,        
       This is to be done on site within a VA Space.
The C&A requirements do not apply, and a Security Accreditation Package is not required.

<DESC><p>This notice is issued by the NASA/JSC to post a Request for Information (RFI) via the internet, and solicit responses from interested parties. This document is for information and planning purposes and to allow industry the opportunity to verify reasonableness and feasibility of the requirement, as well as promote competition. Prospective offerors are invited to submit written comments or questions to: Carlos Roman Contract Specialist and Chrystal Wiseman Contract Officer no later than January 27, 2017. When responding reference NNJ17ZBH004L.<br /><br />Do you have a product, or technology that can help provide Radio Frequency Communication between Earth and a Lunar Space vehicle? If so, NASA-JSC would like to hear back from you!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NASA-JSC is interested in communication systems and products capable of operating on a planetary rover "in-transit" to the moon and on the lunar surface and poles. During the transit phase, the communication system will support low-rate communications with Earth to exchange command, telemetry and calibration data (less than 10kbps). During surface operations, the system will operate at higher data rates to transmit science and engineering data (200 kbps - 1 Mbps). It is desirable for the system to provide radiometric measurements (range, range rate) to support navigation functions. The communication system needs to survive and operate in the environments on the lunar polar surface (low earth angles, vacuum, dust, radiation, and temperature [operating range managed by a thermal control system]); and be compatible with existing commercial and/or NASA ground station assets.<br /><br />This RFI seeks information about communication systems and/or major components (Transponders, Antennas, Gimbals, Traveling-wave-tube amplifiers (TWTA's)/Solid state power amplifiers (SSPA's) etc.) that may be delivered as early as 2019. Solutions with flight heritage are preferred, however, NASA-JSC would be interested in any company, product, or technology that can help NASA meet these needs.</p>
<p>Interested offerors/vendors should provide a summary of their specialized capabilities and/or products to meet the above needs to Carlos Roman at Carlos.roman@nasa.gov no later than 4:30 p.m. Central time on January 27, 2017.</p>

<CONTACT>Ashley S. Loper, Sr. Subcontract Administrator, Phone 5104864844, Email asloper@lbl.gov
<DESC>To Whom it May Concern:
<p>The University of California, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory ("University" or "LBNL") is seeking information on how an interested party would conduct a joint-evaluation of the Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE)'s Cleantech University Prize (Cleantech UP) and Solar Decathlon programs.</p>
<p>This Request for Information (RFI) seeks responses from parties interested in conducting evaluations of the EERE's Cleantech UP and Solar Decathlon programs ; it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future.</p>
<p>LBNL intends to evaluate the submitted information to determine a list pre-qualified suppliers deemed most qualified from among the responses received.  Those deemed most qualified may be invited to submit a proposal in response to an RFP.</p>
<p>1.0	Overview of the Programs to be Evaluated</p>
<p>1.1	Cleantech University Prize Program (Cleantech UP)<br />The Cleantech UP Program  consists of a series of regional university student competitions. Students apply and compete in each region to present their business plans supporting clean energy innovations. The top students from each region are then selected to compete in a national competition. Cleantech UP was designed with the broad aim of marshaling early-stage venture development through entrepreneurship principles and student business plan competitions. Cleantech UP seeks to increase student participation in clean energy entrepreneurship, and to facilitate learning for innovators before and during the early stages of startup company formation.</p>
<p>In preparation to participate in the competitions, students receive mentorship and training, enhancing their entrepreneurial skills and preparing them to launch technologies from their research universities and into the market. The regional and national competitions award cash and in-kind prizes, and provide opportunities for students to develop the business and commercialization skills to move clean energy technologies from discovery to market.</p>
<p>The program's stated goals are to: <br />1.	Catalyze clean energy start-up formation on college campuses ; <br />2.	Support novel training and educational opportunities that equip the next generation of energy entrepreneurs and innovators across the country;<br />3.	Establish a national-level training program and competition for America's top clean energy student entrepreneurs; and<br />4.	Create a sustained and diverse community to support student entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>The Cleantech UP program evolved from a previous initiative - the National Clean Energy Business Plan Competition (NCEBPC). Similar to Cleantech UP, the NCEBPC was a series of regional student business plan competitions across the country, culminating in a national competition. The NCEBPC was held annually in 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015, attracting over 1,000 applicants. Cleantech UP had its first national competition in 2016, and will continue with regional and national competitions in 2017 and in 2018.</p>
<p>DOE currently funds organizations to run Cleantech UP Regional Competitions across the United States. Each Cleantech UP Regional Competition supports the earliest development of individual students and teams and their training. Organizations that run the Cleantech UP Regional Competitions each: <br />&bull;	Run regional competitions annually, including recruiting applicants, mentors, evaluators, judges, and other competition partners; developing a prize competition structure; developing and executing an outreach and marketing plan; promoting the event; and collecting metrics; and <br />&bull;	Award up to $50,000 in cash prizes from DOE along with in-kind and cash awards and services from third parties.</p>
<p>New under Cleantech UP, DOE established a national hub to run the national competition and serve as a central source of student-focused clean energy entrepreneurship training and education. (Previously under NCEBPC, the national competition was run by DOE). The Cleantech UP National Hub is charged with:<br />&bull;	Developing and delivering a premier clean energy entrepreneurship training program, including instruction in commercialization and preparation for the Cleantech UP National Competition and online curriculum for students interested in exploring clean technology entrepreneurship; <br />&bull;	Strengthening and expanding the clean energy student entrepreneurship community;<br />&bull;	Facilitating a learning platform for the Cleantech UP network to share best practices in clean energy entrepreneurship education and regional competition planning and execution; and<br />&bull;	Organizing an annual National Competition-the culmination of the regional Cleantech UP Competitions-and awarding $100,000 in cash prizes from DOE along with in-kind awards and services from DOE and other sponsors.</p>
<p>There will be seven cohorts for the period 2011 to 2018, corresponding to the competition years. A cohort is comprised of teams of university students who participate in a regional competition in a given competition performance period.  Planning begins in June of the prior year, leading up to regional competitions held between February to May, and a national competition in May or June. Thus, the performance period for each competition bridges two calendar years. The cohorts from 2011 to 2015 participated under NCEBPC, while the cohorts from 2015 to 2018 are participating under Cleantech UP. Given the similar structure and goals of the two programs, this evaluation is intended to cover both, with Cleantech UP treated as a continuation of NCEBPC.</p>
<p>1.1.1	Objective of Evaluation<br />The primary objective of the evaluation will be to determine the impacts of the NCEBPC and Cleantech UP programs, taken together.  A secondary objective of the impact assessment will be to determine the impact of the NCEBPC relative to Cleantech UP. The evaluation will include an impact and process component. Examples of impact metrics of interest to DOE include:<br />&bull;	Students' knowledge gained in business, commercialization and entrepreneurship <br />&bull;	Early / mid-career choices leading to a job in the clean energy industry<br />&bull;	New ventures formed / alumni startup of clean-energy business<br />&bull;	Preparedness for clean energy work<br />&bull;	Patents and intellectual property filed, including patents awarded<br />&bull;	Technology commercialized<br />&bull;	Value of skills (e.g., salary, adaptability and transference of skills, etc.)</p>
<p>Some examples of impact evaluation questions to be covered include:<br />A.	What is the impact of NCEBPC and Cleantech UP on individual student participants and teams compared to non-participants on each of the outcomes of interest?<br />B.	What is the impact of the prize money? How is it used, and does the way it was used have an effect on the success of the startup?<br />C.	How many participating teams are currently still operating?</p>
<p>The process component of the assessment will delve into Cleantech UP's implementation, to assess what is working or not working well, and generate appropriate lessons to inform program improvement. It will also explore reasons why there might be differences in participant outcomes (if any) between the NCEBPC cohorts and the Cleantech UP cohorts.</p>
<p>Some examples of process evaluation questions to be covered include:<br />A.	Are there significant differences between the cohorts from the NCEBPC program compared to the cohorts from the Cleantech UP program in the achievement of outcomes?<br />B.	What changes in programmatic factors associated with the two programs explain observed differences in outcomes?</p>
<p>It is expected that data gathering for these assessments will be performed in three separate years: 2017, 2018 and 2019. Data collected in 2017 will be reported on in 2018. Data collected in subsequent years would be used to update the original report, to establish the progression of outcomes.</p>
<p>1.2	Solar Decathlon Program <br />The Solar Decathlon  challenges teams of college students to design, build, and operate solar powered houses that are cost-effective, energy-efficient, and attractive, and then demonstrate them to the public. The first Solar Decathlon was held in 2002, and has occurred biennially since 2005. The winner of the competition is the team that receives the highest score on ten competition criteria, including architecture, engineering, innovation, health and comfort and market potential.  The objectives of the Solar Decathlon Program are to:<br />&bull;	Demonstrate to the public the opportunities presented by innovatively designed, energy-efficient and solar powered houses; <br />&bull;	Educate student participants and the public about clean energy; and <br />&bull;	Provide participating students with unique training that prepares them to enter the nation's clean-energy workforce.</p>
<p>1.2.1	Objective of Evaluation<br />The primary objective of the impact evaluation will be to assess student-centered impacts. It will exclude any assessment of impacts on homeowners, business and other partners, and the DOE Research and Development (R&amp;D) community. The impact evaluation will cover Decathletes who participated starting from 2002 through 2019. The study will also include a limited process component focused on lessons to be learned from the new management and implementation approach beginning with the 2017 Solar Decathlon. Examples of the student-focused outcomes for the Solar Decathlon of interest to DOE include:<br />&bull;	Knowledge gains<br />&bull;	Preparedness for clean energy work<br />&bull;	Clean energy jobs<br />&bull;	Value of skills (e.g., salary, adaptability and transference of skills, etc.)<br />&bull;	Early / mid-career choices<br />&bull;	Alumni start-ups of clean energy business</p>
<p>Some example evaluation questions include:<br />A.	What is the impact of the Solar Decathlon on Decathletes compared to non-Decathletes, on each of the metrics of interest?<br />B.	Are there significant differences between the 2017 Decathletes and 2015 Decathletes in the achievement of outcomes?<br />C.	What factors from the changes implemented in the 2017 Solar Decathlon approach explain observed outcomes? What lessons are to be gleaned from the new approach?</p>
<p>As with the Cleantech UP evaluation, it is expected that data gathering for the Solar Decathlon assessment will be performed in three separate years: 2017, 2018 and 2019. Data collected in 2017 will be reported on in 2018. Data collected in subsequent years would be used to update the original report, to establish the progression of outcomes. The process component of the assessment will delve into the post-2015 implementation. The 2017 Decathlon was contracted out to new management, with some changes in how the competition is now implemented. The programs are being evaluated jointly because they share similar characteristics and outcomes.</p>

<DESC>INTRODUCTION	<br />This is a Small Business Sources Sought (SBSS) notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.<br /> <br />This notice is issued to help determine the availability and type of qualified Small Business companies technically capable of meeting this potential government requirement and to determine the method of acquisition. It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract.   Responses will not be considered as proposals or quotes. No award will be made as a result of this notice. The Government will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by the respondents to this notice.  The notice is strictly for research and information purposes only.
<p>The information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method including small business socio-economic set-aside possibilities and to determine the availability of qualified Small Business companies technically capable of meeting the Government's potential requirement.  All Small Business companies with the capability and availability to perform the requirement under the applicable NAICS code are invited to submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p>NORTH AMERICAN CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (NAICS) CODE<br />The NAICS code applicable to this requirement is 334516 Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing with size standard 1000 employees.<br /> <br />Background<br />The National Institute of Mental Health Intramural Program plans and conducts basic, clinical, and translational research to advance understanding of the diagnosis, causes, treatment, and prevention of mental disorders through the study of brain function and behavior. The Unit on Functional Neural Circuits at NIMH has a potential requirement for a Ti: Sapphire laser for multiphoton microscopy.  The goal of the Laboratory is to study how different brain states modulate sensory representation in the brain.  The lab uses the rodent whisker system as a model for studying top-down modulation of sensory processes because both motor and sensory processes are tightly related behaviorally and anatomically.  The lab follows a multidisciplinary approach that combines electrophysiological, imaging, and optogenetic methods in vivo and uses a two-photon microscope system.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives<br />This Small Business Sources Sought notice seeks to determine eligible sources with the capability to provide the required services and delivery requirement described in this announcement. NIMH has a potential requirement for a fully automated, one-box, mode-locked Ti:Sapphire laser source with automated dispersion compensation and optical table in accordance with the features described in this announcement. <br /> <br />Project Requirements <br />Contractors submitting a response to this Small Business Sources Sought notice shall possess the ability to achieve the government features specified in this potential requirement. Specifically, Offerors to this Small Business Sources Sought notice shall document evidence of being able to provide a laser that achieves the following features:</p>
<p>1. Regenerative mode-locking.  The system should be capable of being tuned over the complete range while staying mode-locked; that is delivering short pulses needed for Two Photon Microscopy.</p>
<p>2. Short pulses, high peak power.  The system requires to produce short pulses (e.g. sub-70 femtosecond pulses on the sample with greater than 400 kW peak power), reducing the opportunity for damaging either cell or optical material and allows deeper penetration in samples.</p>
<p>3. Automated dispersion compensation.  The system requires automatic compensation for the pulse broadening encountered in the optical train of a microscope; lenses, modulators, and filters.</p>
<p>4. Active beam positioning.  To ensure consistent operation over the tuning range and most efficient coupling into the microscope, the system should 	be capable of active positioning on both a tunable laser for the coupling 	between the laser and it is solid-state pump source.  Pointing stability specification should be &lt;50 micro-radians per 100 nm of tuning.</p>
<p>Delivery:  Offerors should indicate an estimated delivery time in full after receipt of an order and any other training or warranty schedules applicable. Inspection and acceptance will be performed at the National Institutes of Health, National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), located at 35 Convent Drive, Building 35A, Bethesda, MD 20892.</p>

Kurt Dronenburg:
kurt.dronenburg@fe.navy.mil
<DESC>Fleet Logistics Center Yokosuka (FLCY) is seeking interested contractors with significant F/A-18A-F and E/A-18G experience to provide scheduled and unscheduled MRO services in support of Fleet Readiness Center Western Pacific (FRCWP) for U.S. Navy and Marine Corps F/A-18A-F and E/A-18G aircraft forward deployed to the Western Pacific region. The MRO line will be located in Government facilities at Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni, Japan.

Contractor MRO support will include the following: 

1)  Planned Maintenance Interval (PMI) work under the Integrated Maintenance Plan (IMP)
IMP requirements provide for airframe, systems and component inspection (through visual and Non-Destructive Inspection (NDI) methods), defect correction, preventative maintenance, operational checkouts and Technical Directive compliance.
 The IMP requirements for aircraft subject to this process are the minimum requirements, formulated and established to the depth required to ensure the reliability, operational availability, safe operation and airworthiness of the aircraft at minimum cost for the duration of the established service period. The IMP Program will provide depot support throughout the total service life of the aircraft.
a.  PMI-1 / PMI-2 events for F/A-18A-D (Legacy) will be based on the latest NAVAIR Specification.
b.  PMI events for F/A-18 E/F and EA-18G (Super Hornet) will be based on the latest NAVAIR Specification.
c.  The estimated Aircraft throughput is 10 - 13 aircraft per year. 
i.  1-2 F/A-18A-D aircraft per year (without expected overlap) 
ii.
  9-11 F/A-18E/F and EA-18G aircraft per year
d.  It is anticipated that the Contractor shall be capable of supporting a nominal workload of 4 aircraft in flow, with a surge capacity to 5 aircraft in flow, regardless of specific T/M/S.
e.  It is anticipated that aircraft inducted for PMI will be towed to the Contractors location at the Government-owned/Government-operated facility (i.e. tow-in versus a fly-in PMI events).

2)  In-Service Repairs (ISR)
Unscheduled maintenance requirements are those requirements (Identified as Depot Level Maintenance) which cannot be directly related to any scheduled requirement described herein and which are discovered as an incidental result of the following functions accomplished as a part of and during the scheduled inspection.
a.
  ISR repairs are expected to be completed either concurrently with PMI events or as standalone actions.
b.  ISR repairs may require the Contractor to dispatch personnel as a contractor field service team (CFT) to perform aircraft ISR throughout Japan (as a minimum) without impacting PMI event turn-around times (TAT).

3)  Aircraft Modifications
a.  Aircraft modifications (e.g. technical directives, airframe changes, etc.) shall be accomplished either concurrently with PMI events or as standalone actions.
b.  The Government will provide the technical data required for completing modifications.

4)  Customer Service
a.  Customer Service requirements include Squadron Operational Level maintenance tasks performed concurrent with PMI activities when approved by the Government.

5)  Engineering Support
a.
  The Contractor shall provide engineering services, including submittal of repair procedures to be reviewed and approved by the Government.

6)  Logistics Support
a.  The Contractor shall provide the Government with timely supply data and material requisition requests necessary for completing aircraft maintenance requirements within the established TAT.

7)  Program Management Support
a.  The Contractor shall assign an on-site Program Manager under this contract. 
b.  The Contractor shall conduct annual Program Management Reviews (PMR).
c.  The Contractor shall attend weekly production meetings.
d.  The Contractor shall provide Production Plans that identify the critical path to PMI completion within the established TAT.

8)  Depot Level Maintenance
Depot level maintenance tasks/actions are those requiring major overhaul or complete rebuilding, remanufacturing, or modification of parts, assemblies, and end items, including support equipment in accordance with IMP Specification and applicable maintenance manuals.


The government is planning a possible Industry Day in support of this requirement to be held at MCAS Iwakuni Japan in March 2017.
 Attendance is anticipated to be limited to United States and Japanese firms and to only four representatives per firm. If the government decides to host an industry day, a separate announcement will be made in the future with additional information.

<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Notice of Intent to Sole Source, IAW FAR 6.302-1(10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1)), Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies Will Satisfy Agency Requirements; whereby Arnold Engineering Development Complex (AEDC), Arnold AFB, TN, intends to award a sole source, fixed price purchase order to Aircraft Research Association Ltd, Manton Lane, Bedford, Bedfordshire, MK417PF, United Kingdom (ARA).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>ARA is the only qualified firm capable of meeting the technical requirements of the mass flow plugs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Arial">This notice is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may submit their interest and capability to the contract specialist below not later than, 24 Dec 2016, 12:00 p.m., Central Time. Based upon the responses to this notice, the Government will determine if this proposed acquisition should be opened to competition.

<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Arnold Engineering Development Complex (AEDC) requires an instrumented Aerodynamic Interface Plane (AIP), a Mass-Flow Measurement/Throttling Systems, and Ejector Systems for testing pressure distortion caused by air flowing from the aircraft's inlet to the turbine engine face. This system will be used for subscale aircraft engine model testing and will simulate the effects of an actual engine on the model. The system will do this by varying the amount of air flowing through the inlet by moving a plug (similar to a door). The more open the mass flow plug, the more air goes through. The amount of air is measured in pound mass per second (lbm/sec) and is referred to as mass flow for the purpose of this notification. The ejector creates a low pressure environment behind the mass flow plug this environment causes a sucking effect through the system. The pressure rakes will hold the high response pressure instrumentation (transducers) in place. To ensure the entire engine face has been mapped for pressure distortion, a grid of 80 transducers (equally spaced based on area) will be required; thus 16 pressure rakes with five transducers on each arm will be needed. This grid of pressure makes up the instrumentation on the AIP. The system must operate from Mach numbers of 0.0 (simulating an aircraft on the runway) to Mach 4.0 (very high supersonic) with pressures ranging from 200 pound per square foot to 3950 pounds per square foot (PSF), and temperatures ranging from 80 to 250 degrees F (this equates to Reynolds numbers from 0.05 to 5 million per foot). The data will be acquired from the pressure rakes using transducers supplied by Kulite Semiconductor Products, Inc. These high sample rate pressure transducers must be accurate in both the constant pressure plus oscillating pressure mode, and in oscillating pressure only mode (known as DC and AC coupled modes). The requirement for highly accurate pressure measurements will reduce the risk of engine failure (due to surge, planer wave or engine stall) for the engine manufacturers.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">A sources sought synopsis was issued on 17 December 2015 with a response date of 21 January 2016.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Only one firm, ARA responded to the sources sought synopsis.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In addition to the sources sought synopsis, AEDC contacted our list of customers (AFRL, LMCO, Boeing, NGC) that use mass flow systems and asked for additional information regarding companies that could build mass flow systems. In all cases there was no other suggested company than ARA as a possible supplier. Several of the companies contacted build their own mass flow systems, however they did not express any interest in building mass flow systems for sale to AEDC. Additionally current mass flow systems used by these companies do not meet the requirements set out by the sources sought synopsis. To this end, the companies that do build their own mass flow systems would have to redesign their current mass flow systems design. ARA currently has designs capable of meeting the design.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>On 10 October 2016 Boeing, NGC, and LMCO were informed that AEDC would be purchasing two mass flow systems instead of one. Consistent with our earlier market resource the before mentions companies did not show any interest with suppling AEDC with two mass flow systems.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>

<DESC>Notice of Intent
<p>The Office of Acquisition and Agreement Management (OAAM), of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), on behalf of the NIST Physical Measurement Laboratory (PML) intends to negotiate on a sole-source basis with iNEMI (International Electronics Manufacturing Initiative) of Herndon, VA, under the authority of FAR Part 13.106-1(b), for a professional organization membership of 5 consecutive years.</p>
<p>The NIST Physical Measurement Laboratory (PML) sets the definitive U.S. standards for nearly every kind of measurement employed in commerce and research, sometimes across more than 20 orders of magnitude. PML is also a world leader in the science of measurement, devising procedures and tools that make continual progress possible.</p>
<p>iNEMI (the International Electronics Manufacturing Initiative) is a non-profit, international, R&amp;D consortium of leading electronics manufacturers, suppliers, associations, government agencies and universities. It is based locally in Herndon, VA, but has regional offices in Asia and Europe, and is led by an international board of directors who represents a cross-section of the electronics manufacturing industry.</p>
<p>Although there are other professional organizations dealing with manufacturing within NIST's list of Approved Professional Organizations, there isn't a counterpart to iNEMI, which is dedicated to the global electronics manufacturing industry. iNEMI is unique in that they focus on electronics. No other approved professional membership is capable of providing the information specifically in electronics to allow PML to meet their mission of setting the definitive U.S. standards for nearly every kind of measurement employed in commerce and research.</p>
<p>Membership benefits include access to a developing technology roadmap which includes a 10-year view of industries technology needs and the paths to meeting them. In addition, iNEMI uses the output of the roadmap process to develop (1) a technical plan of key projects that industry and research institutes can collaboratively work on to address the identified needs and (2) a research priorities document which highlights for researchers the industry's needs and identifies future challenges.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition 813920, with a size standard of 15 million dollars.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations. However, responses received by December 19, 2016 will be considered by the Government.</p>

<p>Anticipated Issue Date: 07 February 2017 - Anticipated Closing Date: 07 March 2017 - 3:00 PM EST (EDT)</p>
<p>The Government is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) announcement as part of market research to justify the Government position to award a sole source contract for software licenses (ARCGIS Desktop and ARCGIS Pro), maintenance, and training to Environmental Systems Research Institute Inc (ESRI). <br />Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division located at Crane, IN intends to award a sole source contract to ESRI; 380 New York St, Redlands, CA 92373-8118. This effort is anticipated to be conducted on a sole source basis in accordance with the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1. The basis for restricting competition is duplicative cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency requirement through any other source. ESRI is the only one that meets the current system requirements for Detail Geospatial production. This software is used throughout all the military services in multiple programs of record. This software is the main production software at the National Geospatial Agency which sets the standard for finalized products for use publicly and militarily.</p>
<p>The Government is seeking information from companies with the capabilities to provide software that meets the current system requirements for Detail Geospatial production or companies that have provided the same or similar capabilities on other Government contracts that may overcome duplication of cost and untimely delays associated with awarding to another vendor.</p>
<p>All interested parties are encouraged to submit company and product literature, a white paper no longer than 5 pages, and/or other pertinent information, such as a description with performance parameters and a statement of current availability, the reason why the Government should not procure this effort on a sole source basis as stated above, and /or identify other Government contracts with similar efforts for the Government(s) consideration.</p>
<p>Responses to the Market Survey shall include the following:</p>
<p>Submitter's Name<br />Street Address, City, State, Zip Code<br />Business Size<br />Point of Contact (POC)<br />POC Telephone<br />Announcement Number: N00164-17-S-NB30</p>
<p>Responses should include availability, budgetary cost estimate, and lead time of the solution, as well as, an explanation on how the duplication of cost and untimely delays associated with awarding to another vendor will be overcome.</p>
<p>Contractors must be properly registered in the Government System for Award Management database (SAM). Contractors may obtain information on SAM registration and annual confirmation of requirements by calling 1-866-606-8220, or via the internet at www.sam.gov.</p>
<p>At the current time, NO FUNDING IS AVAILABLE for contractual efforts. This RFI does not constitute an Invitation for Bids (IFB), a Request for Quote (RFQ), or a Request for Proposal (RFP) and it should not be construed as a commitment of any kind by the government to issue a formal solicitation or ultimately award a contract. The US Government is in no way liable to pay for or reimburse any companies or entities that respond to this announcement. Any costs incurred by interested companies in response to this announcement will NOT be reimbursed.</p>
<p>Market Survey information may be submitted to the Point of Contact any time prior to the expiration of this announcement.

<p>Anticipated Issue Date 09 December 2016 - Anticipated Closing Date 09 January 2017 - 2:00 PM EST</p>
<p>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division has a requirement for Ultra-Lok 8169 Band Clamps that are replaced during the repair of the TR-343 Transducer for the AN/SQS-53C Hull Sonar Array Subsystem, AN/SQQ-89(V) Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) System. The band clamps are a critical component of the TR-343 Sonar Transducer and used for integrated undersea warfare detection, classification, display, and targeting. A solicitation will be issued pursuant to the procedures in FAR Part 13.5 for an anticipated 5-Year, Firm-Fixed Price (FFP), Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract. The contract will be a brand name only basis for procurement of Ultra-Lok 8169 Band Clamps manufactured by Band-It-IDEX, Incorporated, 4799 Dahlia St., Denver, CO 80216-3222 which meets the requirements of the applicable Naval Sea Systems Command drawing and parts list.</p>

<DESC>1.0 CONTRACT INFORMATION
<p>General. This acquisition is being procured in accordance with the Selection of Architects and Engineers statute (also known as the Brooks Act) as implemented per the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Sub Part 36.6, Sub Part 236.6 of the Defense Acquisition Regulations Supplement (DFARS) and Sub Part 5136.6 of the Army Acquisition Regulation Supplement (AFARS); the USACE Acquisition Instructions (UAI); and Engineering Pamphlet (EP) 715-1-7 Architect-Engineer Contracting in USACE. These IDCs are intended to be solicited, evaluated and awarded applying the requirements and procedures identified in the 40 United States Code (U.S.C) Chapter 11, Public Law 92-582, Selection of Architects and Engineers, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Sub-Part 36.6, 10 U.S. Code 2855, Law Applicable to Contracts for Architectural and Engineering Services and Construction Design, Engineering Pamphlet (EP) 715-1-7, Architect Engineer Contracting in USACE, DFARS 219.502-1(2), and DFARS 219.502-2(a)(iii).</p>
<p>It is anticipated that one A-E synopsis will be issued for this requirement. In accordance with FAR 19.502-3, the Contracting Officer plans to set-aside a minimum of three IDCs for small businesses. A target of six A-E IDCs, with a shared capacity of $100M, is contemplated for award; however, the Government reserves the right to award more or no contract at all. This strategy is intended to satisfy the requirements of DFARS 219.502-1(2) and DFARS 219.502-2(a)(iii). The resultant contracts will have a 24-month base ordering period and three 12- month optional ordering periods.</p>
<p>The evaluation board will conduct initial evaluations of qualifications for two separate groups: large businesses and small businesses.<br />All firms will be evaluated against the same primary and secondary selection criteria; however, the Small Business Firms will be ranked separately from the Large Business Firms. All members of the selection board must personally evaluate the SF 330's of all of the highly qualified firms. The firms that demonstrate higher aggregate qualifications relevant to the primary selection criteria are considered to be the most highly qualified firms within each group. Sufficient firms must be recommended to ensure that at least two most highly qualified firms within each group remain "in reserve" when negotiations commence on the final contracts. If two or more firms are technically equal, the secondary criteria will be used as "tie-breakers" and the final ranking of firms will be decided after interviews are conducted. After the initial evaluation of qualifications has taken place to determine the most highly qualified firms for each group, a Request for Price Proposal (RFPP) will be issued to the highest rated firms in each group. Negotiations, as necessary, will take place and if negotiations are not successful with any of the highest rated firms, negotiations will be conducted with the next most highly qualified firm(s), and so on.</p>
<p>Task orders will be awarded detailing technical requirements, deliverables, and schedules. The A-E contractor(s) shall, upon task order award, perform services to meet the requirements of the order as well as comply with all applicable Status of Forces Agreements (SOFA), Federal, State and Local laws, regulations, agreements, Memorandums of Understanding (MOU) and Memorandums of Agreement (MOA) and policies.</p>
<p>IAW the Service Contract Labor Standards (previously known as the Service Contract Act of 1965) as defined in the FAR 37.101, this will be a service acquisition. A-E acquisitions however are not commercial services in nature and thus will not be procured using FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items.</p>

In accordance with DFARS clause 252.236-7009, Option for Supervision and Inspection Services, the Firm may perform any part or all of the supervision and inspection services for the construction contracts resulting from the A-E services, however, the A-E firm will not be responsible for the direct performance of the construction itself. In accordance with FAR 36.209, the A-E Firm and its subcontractors, suppliers, and consultants selected for award will not be considered eligible for DoD construction/design-build contracts that relate to any A-E TOs awarded under this contract. Potential Organizational Conflicts of Interest (OCIs) are also government by FAR Sub Part 9.5.</p>

In keeping with this designation, unclassified information related to USSOCOM military technology acquisitions managed by USSOCOM or any of its component commands, will be designated Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI). As such, the contractor hereby unequivocally agrees that it shall not release to anyone outside the Contractor's organization any unclassified information, regardless of medium (e.g., film, tape, document, contractor's external website, newspaper, magazine, journal, corporate annual report, etc.), pertaining to any part of this contract or any program related to this contract, unless the Contracting Officer has given prior written approval. Furthermore, any release of information which associates USSOCOM, Special Operation Forces (SOF), or any component command with an acquisition program, contractor, or this contract is prohibited unless specifically authorized by USSOCOM.<br />(b) Request for approval shall identify the specific information to be released, the medium to be used, and the purpose for the release. The contractor shall submit the request to the Contracting Officer at least 45 days before the propose date for release for approval. No release of any restricted information shall be made without specific written authorization by the Contracting Office.<br />(c) The protection of sensitive but unclassified data reflecting Special Operations technologies, personnel, plans, and business associations requires due diligence on the part of those in possession of such information. The application of appropriate security measures to ensure the safekeeping of USSOCOM and company proprietary data, intellectual property, and personnel data is the responsibility of all parties who have access to such information. All contractors supporting USSOCOM are required to inform the Contracting Officer within three business days of when there has been a breach or successful penetration of the contractor's network(s) or information system(s). Breaches include unauthorized intrusions of the contractor's server(s) from external parties whether through introduction of malware, hacking, the compromise of access passwords, or any other unauthorized access or compromise. Breaches also include the physical loss of storage media such and disks, hard drives, thumb drives, laptops or other devices which contain duplicates of information contained on the contractor's data systems, or the willful or accidental transmission, copying or posting of contract information which has not been specifically authorized by the Contracting Officer. Estimates of damage and mitigation strategies will be submitted to the Contracting Officer within a period following the breach specified and agreed upon by the Contractor and the Contracting Officer.<br />(d) The Contractor shall include a similar requirement to this clause in each subcontract under this contract. Subcontractors shall submit request for authorization to release and notifications related to cyber security breaches through the prime contractor to the Contracting Officer. <br />(e) The Contractor further understands that Title 18 USC Section 701 specifically prohibits the use of the USSOCOM emblem or logo in any medium (e.g., corporate website, marketing brochure, newspaper, magazine, etc.) unless authorized in writing by USSOCOM.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract<br />awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was<br />established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and timeconsuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a<br />prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p><br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an<br />Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some<br />external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file<br />a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG<br />procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable<br />Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested<br />parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under<br />this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of<br />an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or<br />other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following<br />information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting<br />Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest,<br />protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer<br />through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent<br />Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either<br />the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.<br />Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award<br />or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in<br />writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in<br />less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth<br />in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the<br />protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed<br />within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program<br />should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand<br />delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the<br />Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not<br />to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external<br />forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

Concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to provide these items are invited to submit offers in accordance with the requirements stipulated in this solicitation. No alternate part numbers will be accepted.</p>

<p>&nbsp;NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent<br />Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.<br />Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a USCG procurement to the<br />Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

(Aug. 1996)<br />(a) Definition. "Supplies," as used in this clause, includes but is not limited to raw materials, components, intermediate assemblies, end products, and lots of supplies.<br />(b) The Contractor shall provide and maintain an inspection system acceptable to the Government covering supplies under this contract and shall tender to the Government for acceptance only supplies that have been inspected in accordance with the inspection system and have been found by the Contractor to be in conformity with contract requirements. As part of the system, the Contractor shall prepare records evidencing all inspections made under the system and the outcome. These records shall be kept complete and made available to the Government during contract performance and for as long afterwards as the contract requires. The Government may perform reviews and evaluations as reasonably necessary to ascertain compliance with this paragraph. These reviews and evaluations shall be conducted in a manner that will not unduly delay the contract work. The right of review, whether exercised or not, does not relieve the Contractor of the obligations under the contract.<br />(c) The Government has the right to inspect and test all supplies called for by the contract, to the extent practicable, at all places and times, including the period of manufacture, and in any event before acceptance. The Government shall perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work. The Government assumes no contractual obligation to perform any inspection and test for the benefit of the Contractor unless specifically set forth elsewhere in this contract.<br />(d) If the Government performs inspection or test on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish, and shall require subcontractors to furnish, at no increase in contract price, all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties. Except as otherwise provided in the contract, the Government shall bear the expense of Government inspections or tests made at other than the Contractor's or subcontractor's premises; provided, that in case of rejection, the Government shall not be liable for any reduction in the value of inspection or test samples.<br />(e)<br />(1) When supplies are not ready at the time specified by the Contractor for inspection or test, the Contracting Officer may charge to the Contractor the additional cost of inspection or test.<br />(2) The Contracting Officer may also charge the Contractor for any additional cost of inspection or test when prior rejection makes reinspection or retest necessary.<br />(f) The Government has the right either to reject or to require correction of nonconforming supplies. Supplies are nonconforming when they are defective in material or workmanship or are otherwise not in conformity with contract requirements. The Government may reject nonconforming supplies with or without disposition instructions.<br />(g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be corrected. However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice, by and at the expense of the Contractor. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and, when required, shall disclose the corrective action taken.<br />(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either<br />(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and charge the cost to the Contractor or<br />(2) terminate the contract for default.<br />Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and make an equitable price reduction. Failure to agree to a price reduction shall be a dispute.<br />(i)<br />(1) If this contract provides for the performance of Government quality assurance at source, and if requested by the Government, the Contractor shall furnish advance notification of the time --<br />(i) When Contractor inspection or tests will be performed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract; and<br />(ii) When the supplies will be ready for Government inspection.<br />(2) The Government's request shall specify the period and method of the advance notification and the Government representative to whom it shall be furnished. Requests shall not require more than 2 workdays of advance notification if the Government representative is in residence in the Contractor's plant, nor more than 7 workdays in other instances.<br />(j) The Government shall accept or reject supplies as promptly as practicable after delivery, unless otherwise provided in the contract. Government failure to inspect and accept or reject the supplies shall not relieve the Contractor from responsibility, nor impose liability on the Government, for nonconforming supplies.<br />(k) Inspections and tests by the Government do not relieve the Contractor of responsibility for defects or other failures to meet contract requirements discovered before acceptance. Acceptance shall be conclusive, except for latent defects, fraud, gross mistakes amounting to fraud, or as otherwise provided in the contract.<br />(l) If acceptance is not conclusive for any of the reasons in paragraph (k) hereof, the Government, in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law, or under other provisions of this contract, shall have the right to require the Contractor<br />(1) at no increase in contract price, to correct or replace the defective or nonconforming supplies at the original point of delivery or at the Contractor's plant at the Contracting Officer's election, and in accordance with a reasonable delivery schedule as may be agreed upon between the Contractor and the Contracting Officer; provided, that the Contracting Officer may require a reduction in contract price if the Contractor fails to meet such delivery schedule, or<br />(2) within a reasonable time after receipt by the Contractor of notice of defects or nonconformance, to repay such portion of the contract as is equitable under the circumstances if the Contracting Officer elects not to require correction or replacement. When supplies are returned to the Contractor, the Contractor shall bear the transportation cost from the original point of delivery to the Contractor's plant and return to the original point when that point is not the Contractor's plant. If the Contractor fails to perform or act as required in (1) or (2) above and does not cure such failure within a period of 10 days (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may authorize in writing) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying such failure, the Government shall have the right by contract or otherwise to replace or correct such supplies and charge to the Contractor the cost occasioned the Government thereby.<br />(End of Clause)<br />Alternate I (Jul 1985).

The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and when required shall disclose the corrective action taken. Cost of removal, replacement, or correction shall be considered a cost incurred, or to be incurred, in the total final negotiated cost fixed under the incentive price revision clause. However, replacements or corrections by the Contractor after the establishment of the total final price shall be at no increase in the total final price.<br />(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either<br />(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and equitably reduce the target price or, if established, the total final price or<br />(2) may terminate the contract for default.<br />Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the nonconforming supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and equitably reduce any target price or, if it is established, the total final contract price.

However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and when required shall disclose the corrective action taken. Cost of removal, replacement, or correction shall be considered a cost incurred, or to be incurred, when redetermining the prices under the price redetermination clause. However, replacements or corrections by the Contractor after the establishment of the redetermined prices shall be at no increase in the redetermined price.<br />(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either<br />(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and equitably reduce the initial contract prices or, if established, the redetermined contract prices or<br />(2) terminate the contract for default.<br />Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the nonconforming supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and equitably reduce the initial contract price or, if it is established, the redetermined contract prices.

The program office now anticipates an RFP release in late December 2016 to ensure the release of a well-defined RFP. <br /><br />The Program's aim to refine RFP language stems from its participation as a pilot program for the U.S. Air Force's Bending the Cost Curve (BTCC) initiative. The BTCC initiative seeks to increase competition and find solutions that work for both the U.S. Air Force and industry. Program activities to refine RFP language, including extensive dialogue with industry, have taken longer than initially anticipated to complete. <br /><br />In order to align the production schedule with the Air Force strategic planning, the program's Full Operational Capability has been adjusted from Fiscal Year (FY) 2032 to FY34. It is important to note: the initial Operational Capability date remains FY 24. <br /><br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">09 March 2016:<br /><br /></span></strong>1.

<DESC>(i) This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. <br /><br />(ii) The solicitation number is HSTS05-17-Q-FLT005. The solicitation is issued as a request for proposal (RFP). <br /><br />(iii) The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-92.<br /><br />(iv) This solicitation is set-aside for small business concerns. The associated NAICS code is 315990 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.<br /><br />(v) Contract Line Item Number 0001 Ballistic Panels 600 Each<br /><br />(vi) Description of requirements for the items to be acquired: Ballistic Panels. Technical requirements for the ballistic panels are included in the attached Statement of Work.<br /><br />(vii) Delivery of all ballistic panels shall occur within 30 days after receipt of order or by 31 Jan 17, whichever occurs first. FOB Destination to Egg Harbor Township NJ 08234.<br /><br />(viii) The provision at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors -- Commercial applies to this acquisition. The following addends apply to the provision:
<p>- Paragraph (d) of the provision is deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following:</p>
<p>"<strong>Product samples are required</strong><strong>.</strong> <strong>Samples shall be sent to:&nbsp;COR Terrel Roberts, 601 South 12th Street, Arlington VA 22202.&nbsp; Samples shall be delivered and received by Mr. Roberts&nbsp;no later than 19 Dec 16.&nbsp; Please note that due to enhanced security measures, all packages shipped to&nbsp;TSA by the US Postal Service or shipping carriers (e.g. UPS, Fedex, etc.) undergo security screening which&nbsp;may delay receipt of samples submitted from dates guaranteed by the shipper.&nbsp; Please plan accordingly.</strong><br /><br />The Government requires 2 sample ballistic panels (at no expense to the Government) for necessary manufacturing design and inspection purposes. The samples will be used for technical evaluation and testing purposes, which may involve destructive testing. Using the evaluation process described herein, not all product samples may be tested. Product samples that have been tested will not be returned to the sender under any circumstance. Product samples that have not been tested may be returned at the sender's request and expense. Product samples will not count toward the final order quantities. "</p>
<p>(ix) The provision at 52.212-2, Evaluation -- Commercial Items does not apply to the solicitation. The evaluation procedures to be used are as follows:</p>
<p>- Award will be made using the lowest price technically acceptable (LPTA) selection process. Award may be made on initial quotations. Therefore, each initial quote should contain the quoter's best terms from a technical and price standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to contact quoters if it is later determined by the contracting officer to be necessary. The LPTA process will proceed as follows:</p>
<p>1) Quotes may be removed from consideration for any of the following reasons:</p>
<p>&bull; Quotes that are not received timely<br />&bull; Quotes that fail to follow the instructions in FAR Provision 52.212-1<br />&bull; Quotes that fail to submit any required documentation <br />&bull; Quotes that have language inconsistent with the terms and conditions set forth in the solicitation</p>
<p>2) Quotes will be ordered by price from lowest to highest.</p>
<p>3) The Government will then review Factor 1 of the lowest priced quote. If the review finds that Factor 1 of the lowest priced quote is acceptable, the Government will then evaluate Factor 2 of the lowest priced quote. If the review finds that Factor 2 of the lowest priced quote is acceptable, then the quote is techincally acceptable and the technical evaluation stops at this point.<br /><br />The Government will then evaluate Factor 3 of the lowest priced quote. If the review finds that Factor 3 of the lowest priced quote finds to be&nbsp;satisfactory, that quote represents the best value to the Government and the&nbsp;evaluation process stops at this point. <br /><br />Award of any quote is contingent upon a subsequent determination of price reasonableness and of contractor responsibility by the Contracting Officer.&nbsp; Upon such a determination,&nbsp;award will be made to the lowest-priced quoter without further consideration of any other quoters.</p>
<p>If the lowest quote is determined not to be acceptable for any reason, then the next lowest priced quote will receive an evaluation as described above. The process will continue (in order by price) until a quote from a responsible contractor is determined to be acceptable and priced fairly and reasonably.</p>
<p>4) USING THIS PROCEDURE, THE GOVERNMENT MIGHT NOT EVALUATE ALL QUOTES.</p>
<p>- Each Factor will be evaluated as follows:</p>
<p>Factor 1. Technical Acceptability</p>
<p>Past performance will be rated on an "acceptable" or "unacceptable" basis as follows:</p>
<p>Rating -&nbsp;Description<br />Acceptable - The quoted product meets all technical criterion stated in the Statement of Work.<br /><br />Unacceptable -&nbsp;The quoted product does not meet all technical criterion stated in the Statement of Work.</p>
<p>Factor 2. Past Performance</p>
<p>Past performance will be rated on an "acceptable" or "unacceptable" basis as follows:</p>
<p>Rating -&nbsp;Description<br />Acceptable -&nbsp;Based on the quoter's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the quoter will successfully perform the required effort, or the quoter's performance record is unknown. (See note below.)<br /><br />Unacceptable -&nbsp;Based on the quoter's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the quoter will be able to successfully perform the required effort</p>
<p>Note: In the case of a quoter without a record of relevant past performance, or for whom information on past performance is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past performance rating can be reasonably assigned, the quoter may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance. Therefore, the quoter shall be determined to have unknown past performance. In the context of acceptability/unacceptability, "unknown" shall be considered "acceptable."</p>
<p><strong>Note: Quoters are not required or requested to submit past performance references. The Government will use public and Government-restricted sources (e.g. PPIRS) to evaluate past performance.</strong></p>
<p><br />Factor 3. Price</p>
<p>Price will not be rated. Price analysis will be conducted to determine reasonableness.<br /><br />(x) Quoters are required to include a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications -- Commercial Items with its quote.<strong> Quoters shall complete only paragraph (b) of this provision if they have completed the annual representations and certification electronically via the System for Award Management (SAM) Web site accessed through http://www.acquisition.gov . If the Quoter has not completed the annual representations and certifications electronically, it shall complete only paragraphs (c) through (q) of this provision.<br /></strong><br />(xi) The clause at 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items applies to this acquisition. There are no addenda to the clause.<br /><br />(xii) The clause at 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes Or Executive Orders -- Commercial Items applies to this acquisition.

<DESC>The Federal Bureau of Prisons is seeking concerns having the ability for providing Residential Reentry Center (RRC) services (in-house RRC beds) and Home Confinement services (home confinement placements) for male and female Federal offenders held under the authority of United States Statutes located in the Southern District of Illinois within the counties of Franklin, Jackson, or Williamson.
<p><br />Both the RRC services for in-house RRC beds and the Home Confinement services for home confinement placements shall be in accordance with the Federal Bureau of Prisons Statement of Work entitled, "Residential Reentry Center, October 2016 (Corrected)." Home Confinement services (for home confinement placements) are specifically defined in chapter 11, programs, of the aforementioned SOW. Additional requirements for these services are referenced throughout the SOW as well.<br /><br />This will be a Firm-Fixed Price contract for services with a one year base period, and four one-year options periods.<br /><br />The RRC In-House requirement will consist of a 61 bed facility in which 50 beds will be designated for males and 11 beds designated for females.<br /><br />The Home Confinement requirement will consist of 30 placements to include both male and female. The Home Confinement Radius will be within 100 miles of the facility.</p>
<p>It is the intent of the Government to award both line items (RRC in-house beds and home confinement placements) to a single provider, as these services are interconnected and rely upon each other to ensure adequate programming and case management of offenders. The Government reserves the right to potentially make an award which is deemed to be in the best interest of the Government.<br /><br />RFP-200-1370-CS will be available on or about January 9, 2017, and it will be distributed solely through the General Services Administration's Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website at http://www.fbo.gov. Hard copies of the solicitation will not be available. The site provides downloading instructions. Future information about this acquisition will also be distributed through this site. Interested parties are responsible for monitoring this site to ensure that they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition. The estimated closing date of RFP-200-1370-CS will be on or about March 10, 2017.<br /><br />All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by this agency. No collect calls will be accepted. No telephone request or written requests for the solicitation will be accepted.<br /><br />Faith-Based and Community Organizations can submit offers/bids/quotations equally with other organizations for contracts for which they are eligible.</p>

<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">The NAVAL AIR SYSTEMS COMMAND (NAVAIR), Propulsion and Power Engineering Department, are soliciting proposal abstracts for technologies that will significantly increase the mission performance, operational capabilities, reduce the total ownership cost, and improve system readiness of Naval Air Vehicles. Solicitation Number: N68335-17-R-0021 Broad Agency Announcement (BAA). Topics include development of Advanced Aircraft Power Systems; Fuel Technology; Aircraft Energy Conservation and Environmental Compliance; Propulsion and Power System, Condition Based Maintenance, Prognostics, Diagnostics, and Health Monitoring; and Advanced Propulsion System Technology. Detailed information is provided in the NAVAIR publication "Guide to Naval Aviation Propulsion and Power Technology Development Programs for Fiscal Year 2017". The aforementioned guide is attached to this FBO announcement. <br />This notice constitutes a NAVAIR Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) contemplated in FAR 6.102(D)(2)(i). This announcement and any modifications to this announcement will be open through 14 November 2017 in the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOps). White Papers (WP) and Proposals can be submitted any time during this period. WPs (as described below) need to be coordinated with the appropriate technical area leader and may result in a request for a formal proposal. This is needed to reduce unnecessary proposal preparation work for efforts that may not be of interest to the Navy, or because of the uncertainty of program budgets. Evaluations will be conducted by a panel of government experts using the following criteria: Scientific and technical merits of the proposed research to include, (1) the degree to which proposed research and development objectives support the targeted technical topic and (2) validity of the technical basis for the approach offered; and potential contributions to the Navy Propulsion, Power and Energy objectives to include (1) relevance to the stated technology areas of interest; (2) anticipated operational military (or commercial, if applicable) utility; (3) ability of proposed system/study to be rapidly ready for transition; (4) suitability for transition to Navy systems; and (5) projected affordability of transitioning the technology to the fleet Other evaluation criteria, of lesser importance but equal to each other are; The offeror's capabilities, related experience, past performance on similar efforts, research personnel, facilities, techniques or unique combination of these which are integral factors for achieving the proposal objectives and the realism and reasonableness of cost, including proposed cost sharing. No further criteria will be used in the evaluation. The technical and cost information will be evaluated at the same time. Further details on these criteria are contained in the aforementioned Guide. Selection for award will be based on the potential benefit to the Government weighed against the cost of the proposals, in view of the availability of government funds. Cost plus fixed fee, cost sharing, and cost contracts are anticipated. Other types of contracts may be proposed, but offerors are advised that the Government is under no obligation to accept. Specific reporting requirements cited on the Contract Data Requirements List (DD1423) shall be specified within each contract award. At a minimum all offerors will be required to submit the following reports: a) Detailed Planning Report; b) Progress Report; c) Financial Reports; d) Test Plans; e) Program Reviews; f) Presentation Material; and g) Final Report. Proposal submission process, format and content, as well as deliverable items are delineated in the above mentioned NAVAIR Guide. Initial proposals or White Papers (WP) should not exceed 30 pages in length, including a cost estimate. BRIEFNESS IS DESIRABLE - WPs RANGING FROM A FEW PAGES TO 15 PAGES ARE THE NORM. Cost estimates in WPs for stand-alone subsets of effort are encouraged. Offerors of those WPs found to be consistent with the intent of the BAA will be invited to submit a formal cost and technical proposal.

<DESC><strong>RELEASE OF DRAFT RFP<br /></strong><br />The OTH-WS draft Request for Proposal (RFP) Sections B through&nbsp;K are&nbsp;attached to this special notice.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sections L and M are not provided as part of the draft, but the conceptual approach for both sections will be addressed at Industry Day during the Navy OTH-WS Program Brief. Interested vendors should note that, in order to promote full and open competition to the maximum extent practicable, the Navy intends to structure the RFP to allow for flexibility in meeting the missile range and Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP-C) requirements contained in the OTH-WS Top Level Requirements Document (TLRD). The intent is to allow the Government to potentially consider an award to an Offeror whose existing OTH-WS does not meet either the missile range or the SWaP-C TLRD requirement. Offerors will have the opportunity to propose improvements to their missile range or SWaP-C to meet the TLRD requirements. However, in order to be considered for award, the existing system must meet either missile range or SWaP-C requirements (i.e., an existing system that does not meet both the missile range and SWaP-C TLRD requirements will not be eligible for award).
