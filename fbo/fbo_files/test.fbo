<DESC>The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) is soliciting proposals from qualified small business organizations capable of providing the resources to support the Clinical Trials Network (CTN).  The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541611.  The small business size standard is $5 million.

In an effort to dramatically improve drug abuse treatment throughout the country, the NIDA established the CTN in September 1999 with the award of five Regional Research and Training Centers (RRTCs).  Each RRTC is affiliated with 10-15 Community-based Treatment Programs (CTPs).  Multi-site clinical trials will be performed in these CTPs.  In 2000, another 6 were awarded, and in 2001, 3 additional were awarded.  There are 14 RRTCs now, with an eventual goal of 20-30 RRTCs nationwide.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has a requirement for services and is soliciting quotes from interested offerors for services to support a two-and-one-half day conference which is planned to be held from October 21 through 23, 2002. 

The conferencing facility shall have rooms available to accommodate approximately 165 overnight attendees.  The facility also must have a single conference room large enough to accommodate approximately 200 attendees in a classroom setting and four breakout rooms, which can each accommodate 35  to 50 persons comfortably in a classroom style setup and have room for a speakers panel and dais.  Internet connections will be required for the large conference room and at least two of the breakout rooms.  The facility shall provide audiovisual equipment, photocopier and telefax services as needed to support the conference.  The facility shall be able to accommodate the following meal schedules for approximately 200 attendees: a continental breakfast consisting of coffee, tea, juice, breakfast rolls/bagels and cream cheese and fresh fruit for 2 days; morning and afternoon breaks consisting of snacks, coffee, tea, and soft drinks for 2 days; lunch to include 3 entr?e choices or a buffet for 3 days; and dinner to include a choice of at least 3 entr?es or buffet for 2 days.  The facility must be sufficiently staffed to provide these services in a timely fashion, being able to provide lunch and dinner within a 60 to 75-minute time span.  The facility must have sufficient tables and enough staff to accommodate approximately 200 people per meal, at the same time, in the same location.
The training provided will be intense, beginning mid-morning on the first day (in order to allow for travel and check-in), and continuing into evening programs/sessions the first evening; from 7:00 a.m. until 5:00 p.m. the second day, and from 7:00 a.m. until 2:00 p.m. the last day.  It is necessary for the symposium location to be held sufficiently far from the employees' workplace so that they are free to concentrate on the training provided, yet close enough to the NIH to allow participants who must return home each day to retain that option.
All quotes must be able to meet the following requirements:

1.	Federal Government 2002 per diem rates.

2.	A location between 35-50 miles from the National Institutes of Health, located in Bethesda/Rockville, Maryland.  The location must be accessible by public transportation and be able to provide parking for approximately 150 cars to accommodate attendees, speakers, support staff, etc. who drive to the conference. 

3.	Per Public Law 101-391, federally funded meetings and conferences must be held in properties that adhere to the fire and life safety requirements of the Hotel and Motel Fire Safety Act of 1990.  The website located at http://www.usfa.fema.gov/hotel/index.cfm, includes facilities that currently meet these requirements.  If offerors currently do not meet the stated requirements and are not included on the Master Listing, then they must include a plan with their quote to show how they intend to meet these requirements by the time of the conference.

<DESC>The Office of Surface Water (OSW), Water Resources Division (WRD), U. S. Geological Survey intends to award a non-competitive contract to CODAR Ocean Sensors, Ltd., Los Altos, CA, to perform the Phase II field evaluation of radar technology to remotely measure river total discharge (stream-gaging) without any instruments in the water -- Non-contact River Discharge Measurement.  CODAR has successfully completed Phase I of the evaluation.

Preliminary testing of radar system:  A formal 2-day test period will be conducted in January/February, 2002 to establish feasibility and preliminary accuracy of UHF Backscatter RiverSonde approach to monitoring surface flow with distance across river.  This field experiment will presumably be done at a site selected by the USGS near Vernalis gaging station in California, where the same site will be used for the subsequent deployment during Spring runoff period.  During the field experiment, the USGS technical staff will also participate to collect ground-truth data in support of CODAR Ocean Sensors evaluating their radar systems.   CODAR will be free to conduct their own further tests at this location before and after the two-day formal test period, to gather data and experience.

A two-month deployment of the same radar system, after modifications to both hardware and software suggested by the findings from the preliminary test periods.  This will be done at a site selected by the USGS, presumably the Vernalis gaging station.  Power and phone lines will be available, as well as some measure of security for the equipment afforded by cognizant locals near the site.  The system will be programmed to run automatically for measuring water surface velocity distribution at the site, recording data throughout the day and nighttime periods.  Near-real-time processing of the data for the site will occur, so that the velocity distribution data can be examined within days of acquisition.  The ultimate goal, of course, is to achieve an on-site real-time data-processing capability.  

A report will be written by CODAR Ocean Sensors at the end of this phase highlighting the results and assessing its operational potential for the intended purpose of continuously measuring river water surface velocity distribution. The report will contain a specific section comparing CODAR surface-velocity data with ground-truth data as collected by USGS.

THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  Information will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Determination to compete this requirement is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Responses to this notice must be submitted via e-mail to: fyee@usgs.gov by 12/28/2001.  No additional synopsis will be published.  See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be requir

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation Number is SP3100-02-T-0085.

The Government has tested other packaging films; however, none of the tested products have been able to withstand the temperature generated by the Instapak packaging system.  The authority to contract without providing for full and open competition is supported by the required justifications and approvals.  The delivery address for these products will be:  Defense Distribution Depot San Diego (DDDC), Naval Station North Island, Bldg 656, San Diego, CA  92135.  Prices should be quoted FOB destination.  The name and telephone number of the Government point of contact will be provided at the time of award.

<DESC>The Department of State intends to enter into negotiations with American Management Systems, Inc., 12601 Fair Lakes Circle, Fairfax, VA  22033, for implementation, maintenance, and enhancement services for its worldwide financial management systems.  There are two primary systems requiring support.  The Central Financial Managment System (CFMS) is the Department's core accounting system and is comprised of the Federal Financial Systems (FFS) COTS software and approximately 18 interfaces with other financial or mixed systems.  The Department acquired a 30-year license for FFS in 1987.  The Regional Financial Management System (RFMS) is comprised of the Momentum Financials Plus COTS software, an in-house developed disbursing system, and numerous interfaces to other financial or mixed systems.  The Department acquired a 30-year license for Momentum in 1999.  The Department has recently begun production operations with RFMS at its Financial Service Center (FSC) in Charleston, S.C.  Implementation in the Bangkok, Thailand FSC is scheduled to begin in 2002.  The Department's core accounting functions will be migrated to Momentum and integrated with RFMS by FY2005.  The resultant contract is projected to be for a five-year period ( a one year base with 4 one year option periods).   All responsible sources shall respond by submitting a written narrative statement of capability, including detailed technical information and other technical information literature demonstrating the ability to meet the above requirements.  The reponse must be sufficient to permit agency analysis to establish a bona fide capability to meet the requirement.  No telephone requests will be honored.  Failure to submit documentation will result in the Government proceeding with negotiations.

<DESC>NA The following are questions and responses from industry in regards to the solicitation.  Paragraph 2.19 is hereby deleted in its entirety. 1.  What is a labor city? We need clarification to let the hotels know whether to be used or omitted.   Response:  Paragraph 2.14 & and the language gaming city & labor city in paragraph 2.19 have been removed in their entirety. 2. What is the percentage of government rooms that will be needed?  Response:   Refer to CLINS for breakout of room requirements. 3.  Is it possible to shift the pattern from Sunday through Monday?  Response:  The pattern for the symposium must remain Monday through Thursday.  This eliminates the requirement for the Government to pay overtime for employees traveling on weekends  4.  Are we to submit our final selection on a Hotel/Convention Center as part of our Proposal or are we to give a selected few recommendations, ranked according to our selection criteria?  If it is only one location, will that location be the one used for the conference if our organization is selected as the winner? Response:  Yes, submit the final selection in accordance with Paragraph 2.11.  5.  Is this a Firm Fixed Price, Time and Materials, or Cost Plus Fixed Fee Contract? Response:   Fixed Price Contract 6.  Can we get progress payments for planning and preparation hours associated with the Symposium Agent and our Web Developer's time (which are costs incurred well in advance of the actual week of the conference); and also some hotels and vendors will requ ire deposits - can these deposits also be progressed billed as incurred?      Response:  No, but the government would consider commercial interim payments in accordance with FAR Part 32.         7.  Please explain - for non-government attendees you would like the hotel rates quoted exclusive of taxes and fees…does this mean that non-government attendees will have to be responsible for those fees or does that mean you would like contractor to  negotiate with the hotel to accept no taxes and no fees on hotel rates?  We understand that government attendees will be excluded from the tax and fee charge by virtue of being government. Response:  Applicable taxes and fees should be separately stated.         8.  Are there any differences in processing a government credit card from processing any other credit cards?  If so, what are the additional requirements? Response:  Yes.  The processing and transactions charges imposed by credit card companies are typically higher.        9.  Are all exhibitors government or are there industry exhibitors as well?  If not, are the industry exhibitors responsible for the fees associated with their booths or does the government pay those fees?

<CONTACT>Peggy Melanson, 703-325-6096
<DESC>NA The BAA for Wide Area Detection is modified to permit the use of contractor operated aircraft and to extend the proposal due date until 28 January 2002.  The proposal submittal information and evaluation criteria have been modified to implement these chang es. Prospective offerors are encouraged to access the entire BAA (solicitation DAAB15-02-R-0005, file:  WA_BAA-R1) via the Army Business Opportunity page at http://abop.monmouth.army.mil. The new sections follow.  PROPOSAL SUBMITTAL - Proposals shall consi st of three primary sections: Technical, Management and Cost. The Technical section shall be no more than 25 pages of a concise description of the technology(s) being proposed. The technical section shall include the objectives of the proposed effort, the technical issues requiring resolution to accomplish the objectives, and the approach to resolving these issues.  At minimum, the following information is required: System description and capabilities; Data recording devices and their capabilities as well a s recording media and format(s); Operational support requirements during flight tests; Integration of system onto NVESD test aircraft (Twin Otter, UH-60, or UH-1); or contractor operated aircraft.  While the Government would prefer that sensors be integrat ed onto NVESD aircraft to permit simultaneous recording of data from co-located sensors, bidders may propose usage of contractor owned aircraft if clear and convincing benefit can be demonstrated to the Government in terms of cost and schedule. Timeframe d uring which system would be available; Cost of a duplicate system; Description of current or past experience in remote sensing. The Management portion (10 pages maximum) shall include proposed team organizational structure and curriculum vitae for the Proj ect Manager and other key personnel. The Cost portion shall consist of a cost breakdown of the effort being proposed in a manner that organizes the technical approach into meaningful phases allowing the Government to contract for all or portions of a techn ical proposal. While no specific format is required, cost proposals should delineate specific direct (labor, material, travel, ODC etc) and indirect costs related to this effort.  Proposals are due by 28 January 2002 at 1400 hours Eastern Standard Time and  must be submitted to CECOM Acquisition Center-Washington, ATTN:  AMSEL-AC-WB-B (Melanson), 2461 Eisenhower Avenue, Room 1126, Alexandria, VA 22331-0700. All proposals shall be submitted in Microsoft Office Software (Word, Excel, Powerpoint) format or Adob e pdf format via electronic media (CD-ROM, Iomega Zip (100/250 disks)). No proposal hard copies shall be provided, however, a cover letter that contains the offeror's street address as well as a company point of contact with current email address, telephon e number and fax number, shall be included.  EVALUATION CRITERIA - Proposals will not be evaluated against each other since they are not submitted in accordance with a common work statement. Evaluations of the proposals will be conducted using the followin g four criteria (listed in order of importance): 1. The degree to which the proposal addresses the technical goals of this BAA for wide area detection performance with emphasis on operability above 1000 feet, sensor swath greater than 500 feet, buried mine  and wide area munition detection performance or the proposal demonstrates, clear and convincingly, that it is a significant breakthrough over existing systems. The following may be considered under this factor: the overall scientific and technical merits of the proposal; the extent to which the proposed approach offers significant potential improvements in comparison to current technologies being used or developed; the degree to which the proposed technology's phenomenology will be implemented in a hardwar e or software prototype and assessed in field testing (as opposed to testing in a laboratory environment or paper study).

<DESC>DESCRIPTION:  

1.  This procurement is for one solicitation, structured as a Multiple Award Construction Contract (MACC) resulting in the award of three Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) construction contracts.  One of the contracts will be set-aside for a qualified 8(a) firm, provided an acceptable proposal is submitted, price and technical factors considered. The remaining two contracts will be made to the two firms considered to be the Best Value and will be competed UNRESTRICTED.  If sufficient qualified 8(a) firms apply and are considered ?Best Value?, it is possible that more than one contract will be awarded to 8(a) firms.  We will utilize two-step, Source Selection Procedures for this procurement. This method permits evaluation of proposals based on price competition, technical merit and other factors; permits impartial and comprehensive evaluation of offerors' proposals; permits discussions if necessary; and the use of a trade-off process when it may be in the best interest of the Government to consider award to other than the lowest priced offeror(s) or other than the highest technically rated offeror(s).   The work will primarily consist of General Construction  (NAICS Code Sector 233, 234, 235).  The majority of the work will be concentrated at, but not limited to the following locations: NAS PENSACOLA REGION (including NTTC Corry Station; Saufley Field; NAS Whiting Field) and NAVAL HOSPITAL, PENSACOLA.  Work will also be performed at NAVAL COASTAL SYSTEMS COMMAND, PANAMA CITY, FL; NAVAL RESERVE CENTERS IN FL and AL; and COAST GUARD STATION, MOBILE, AL. 

2.  The total estimated value for all three contracts is $25,000,000 for the base and three option years.  Award will be made to the three responsible proposers whose proposals, conforming to the RFP, will be most advantageous to the Government, resulting in the Best Value, cost or price and other factors considered.  After award of the initial contracts, the three successful offerors will compete for task orders based on either Best Value to the Government or Lowest Price Technically Acceptable.  The awardees will be encouraged to submit technical and price proposals on all future task orders which will ranging in estimated value from $25,000 to $3,000,000.  Lack of participation may result in the Government not exercising the option for extending the contract.  Firms participating in the pre-proposal conferences or subsequent on-site scoping process will not be compensated for their participation.  Proposers are advised that it is definitely possible that award may be made without discussions or any contact concerning the proposals received.  Therefore, each initial offer should contain the offeror?s best terms from price, schedule and technical standpoint.

3.  Phase I of the procurement process is a narrowing phase to approximately five ? seven offerors based on factors that include:  Past Performance, Technical Qualifications, Scheduling, and Small Business subcontracting Effort. Phase I factors relate to the base year and three option year IDIQ contract requirements for general building type projects including administrative, training, dormitory, and community support type facilities, not just the seed project identified in Section 00150 of the RFP.  Only those offerors selected in Phase I will be allowed to proceed into Phase II.  In Phase II, the competitive field will be required to submit additional information on Factor B (Technical) and price proposals for a ?seed? project which has been identified as an Ultraviolet (UV) Disinfection System at the Wastewater Treatment Plant located at NAS Pensacola, FL.  The estimated price range for the seed project is $250,000 - $500,.000.   Firms are expected to participate in the pre-proposal conference.  The Government may choose to award the seed project based on initial proposals without holding discussions. The Government reserves the right to reject any or all proposals at any time prior t

<DESC>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Dryden Flight Research Center (DFRC) is releasing a Sources Sought for the Space-Based Telemetry and Range Safety (STARS) Study.  NASA has initiated the study to identify, develop and test hardware for future telemetry and range safety applications.  NASA is interested in the development and flight test of satellite telemetry link hardware for Phase 2 of the STARS Study. The STARS Study is investigating the feasibility of supplementing ground based telemetry remote sites with satellite based systems.  The satellite based system would transmit data to and receive data from an Expendable Launch Vehicle (ELV), Reusable Launch Vehicle (RLV) or Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) via a central ground station.  Key study parameters include link reliability, link margin, signal acquisition/reacquisition time, command processing time, data latency, GPS system performance, vehicle position/attitude/velocity measurements, bit error rate performance in a high dynamic environment, maximum data rates, data coding options/performance, on-board tracking antenna capabilities/performance/coverage, and on-board tracking antenna flight control interface and control algorithms. The required telemetry link hardware will support a duplex satellite data link and utilize an existing satellite system.  The satellite Forward link will provide vehicle command and control data to the ELV/RLV/UAV.  The desired Forward link data rates are in the 10kbps to 100kbps range.  The satellite Return link will contain multiplexed telemetry, timing, position, video and voice data from the ELV/RLV/UAV.  The desired composite Return link data rate is 1Mbps to 7Mbps.  The data links will utilize a standard modulation format (BPSK, QPSK, etc.) which is supported by an existing satellite.  The satellite selected for the study should be capable of supporting links to ELV/RLV's launched from the Eastern or Western ranges and RLV/UAV's launched from Edwards AFB. The primary focus of responses to this Request for Information should concern capabilities to develop antenna hardware and other methods to increase satellite link data rates and reliability for the high data rate telemetry return link.  Interested vendors are encouraged to comment on possible methods to achieve the high data rate goals of Phase 2 of the STARS Study. NOTE: THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. THIS IS NOT A FORMAL PROCUREMENT AND THEREFORE IS NOT A SOLICITATION. THIS NOTICE IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO ULTIMATELY ISSUE AN IFB, RFP, RFQ, OR CONTRACT.  No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in the CBD and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service. It is the potential offerors responsibility to monitor these cites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis.

<DESC>The Navy's Strategic Systems Program (SSP) is soliciting Power Projection payload options as part of an overall SSGN Payloads and Sensors Study.  The ideas, alternatives, and technical specifications comprising the payload options must support two key mission areas: Joint Suppression of Enemy Air Defense (JSEAD) and Interdiction Operations during a Major Regional Conflict (MRC).  Payload options may include weapons, decoys, or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) whose mission subset includes targeting.  The options will be assessed in the context of submarine transformational payloads with emphasis on SSGN insertion, including a 2010 Initial Operational Capability (IOC).The resulting options acquired under this BAA will be used to ensure that all possible information about existing or potential system designs, concepts, and technologies is considered by the Government.  The study will be led by SSP, with assistance from the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division.  The study team will use the deliverables from this BAA in their evaluation and analysis. 

In order to foster innovative approaches and design concepts that are affordable and that meet demanding SSGN requirements, industry is strongly encouraged to participate in the submittal of system options.  Multi-team approaches are also encouraged to develop new ideas and alternatives.

Organizations interested in providing potential Power Projection payload options should submit a white paper in lieu of expending extensive effort in preparing a detailed research and price proposal in response to this BAA.  The white paper enables the Government to determine how specific ideas/concepts/innovations may or may not be of interest, with very little expense to the submitter.  

This synopsis constitutes a BAA per FAR 6.102(d)(2).  There will be no formal Request for Proposals or other solicitation issued in regard to this announcement and there are currently no objectives or plans for a follow-on solicitation or progression into an Analysis of Alternatives (AoA). It should be noted that Section 845 authority of the National Defense Act of FY 1994 (Public Law 103-160), Section 804 of the National Defense Act of FY 1997 (Public Law 104-201), and 10 USC Section 2371 may be invoked permitting other transactions authority where appropriate in future procurements and solicitations.  Although no portion of this announcement is set aside for HBCU/MI participation, concepts are invited from all sources.  This BAA should not be construed as a commitment or authorization to incur costs in anticipation of a resultant agreement.  Information provided herein is subject to modification by the Government, and does not bind the Government to award a contract.

Area of Interest:  This BAA is intended to solicit ideas and concepts that identify and quantify key technologies, performance, and engineering issues in order to study and evaluate SSGN Power Projection payload options.  Although not specifically planned, entry into an SSGN Power Projection Payload acquisition program in the future may be facilitated by the study results.  Key technical areas and system concepts are expected to include, but not be limited to, mission planning, targeting, fire control, launcher, advanced navigation, flight control, guidance, propulsion, seeker, fuzing, submunition, and warhead technologies.  For the purposes of this BAA, the Power Projection payload option comprises a system in all variations; the dedicated weapon system and the required physical, electrical, and electronic interfaces with the SSGN.  Submittals may address individual systems or the full spectrum of systems as defined above, although full (end-to-end) system concepts are encouraged.
 

White Papers:  Prospective organizations are invited to submit white papers on or before 21 January 2002 summarizing each proposed concept, its capabilities, and its cost and schedule estimates. All proprietary portions of the white paper must

<SUBJECT>A -- Wide-Area Search Synthetic Aperture Radar (WASSAR) Seeker
<DESC>A -- INTRODUCTION: 
This is a Program Research and Development Announcement (PRDA).  The Air Force Research Laboratory, Munitions Directorate, Advanced Guidance Division (AFRL/MNGS) is interested in receiving technical and cost proposals for development and demonstration of a Wide-Area Search Synthetic Aperture Radar (WASSAR) seeker for autonomous precision-guided munition applications.  The overall WASSAR program objective is to design, develop, test and demonstrate a breadboard SAR seeker to investigate, and further develop the use of high-resolution SAR seeker technology for wide-area search munitions.  Proposals in response to this PRDA must be received no later than 3:00 P.M. CST on 31 Jan 2002, addressed to Air Force Research Laboratory, Munitions Contracting Division, Bldg. 13, 101 W. Eglin Blvd., Suite 337, Eglin AFB FL 32542-6810, Attn.: Ms Dona Dowdy-Merchant (AFRL/MNK).  Proposals submitted after the cut-off date specified herein shall be treated in accordance with FAR 52.215-1(c)(3), "Instructions to Offerors-Competitive Acquisition (May 2001)".  Responders must reference the following number (MNK-PRDA-02-0003). Proposals submitted must be in accordance with this announcement.  Since this is a PRDA, there will be no formal request for proposal or other solicitation regarding this announcement.  Offerors should be alert to any PRDA amendments that may be published.  The Government reserves the right to amend the due date to allow for subsequent submission-of-proposal dates.  If a proposal is selected to satisfy the PRDA objectives as a result of the first submission, subsequent opportunities for proposal submission will not be available. Please be advised that this is the final PRDA. 
B-- REQUIREMENTS:  
(1)  Background: Present-day Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensors are capable of producing high-resolution imagery in adverse weather conditions, and are used heavily in surveillance and reconnaissance.   New and faster processing techniques enable SAR sensors to produce high-resolution, wide field-of-view images at near real-time frame rates, and current radar hardware and supporting electronics can be compactly packaged making SAR sensors attractive for use in munitions seeker applications.  Additionally, SAR sensors can be configured to process in a SAR mode and a Moving Target Indication (MTI) mode, which enables the same sensor to be used for acquiring and tracking stationary and moving mobile/re-locatable targets.  New techniques also provide SAR sensors with the capability of acquiring and classifying moving targets.  
While past SAR seekers were employed against fixed, high-value targets for terminal weapon guidance, the future evolution of SAR seekers is geared toward searching wide areas, classifying mobile/re-locatable targets, and fitting on weapons that are less than six inches in diameter.  Future SAR seekers will be used to search, acquire and classify stationary and moving mobile/re-locatable targets.  This capability will require high resolution SAR as well as innovative signal processing techniques to complete the search and classification role.  Additionally, the future SAR seekers are expected to result in reduced cost and improved performance relative to existing seeker systems and concepts.  Reduced costs will be realized through the use of commercial off-the-shelf components and the use of previously developed hardware and software.  Improved system performance will be realized through increased frame rates, wider area coverage, adverse weather penetration and new techniques for imaging moving targets with SAR seekers.  
AFRL/MN has established Integrating Concepts (ICs) that will serve as the program baseline in terms of the seeker?s performance capability and requirements.  In general, the integrating concepts support a direct attack type mission and a wide-area search and attack type mission.  These missions have different flight profile, operating range, field of view (FOV), area co
