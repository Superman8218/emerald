<DESC>CABLEWAY REPAIR (NEW CABLE INSTALLATION)

Amendment 2 - Pre-proposal Site visit date clarification (Site visit is Dec 14th) See amendment for full details).  

This is a 100% small business set-aside construction project.  

The requirement is to reinstate our USGS cableway on the Clearwater River at Spalding, ID (Station ID 13342500).   The USGS Idaho Water Science Center (ID WSC) has had a cableway at this site for over 30 years. The cable was decommissioned (removed) back in 2010, and the existing cable was damaged during the removal and cannot be reused.  All of the cableway structures were left in place at that time. 

New cable for the cableway needs to be installed to restore this cableway to a functional state, and to enable the USGS to safely make streamflow measurements, collect suspended sediment, and bedload data in support of USGS and other agencies water science. 

Prospective contractors must be licensed general contractor in the State of Idaho.  Work location is Spaulding, ID and is not federal property.

See RFQ for additional details and requirements.
