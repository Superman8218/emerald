Subject: Requesting Feedback For A New Market Intelligence/Opportunity Capture Startup

Hello {{first_name}},

Looking at the federal SAM database, I can see that your company does government contracting.  I know how time consuming it can be to dig through all of the opportunities out there until you find one that is a fit for your company.  It takes up tons of time that you could be spending in more productive ways.  And once you find the opportunity, there is mountain of research that needs to be done before you can respond with a proposal.

That's why we have a new startup in the government contracting space, called EmeraldGov.  We want to solve the problem of identifying good opportunities and then quickly responding to them.

We are currently in the customer development phase, which means we are gathering feedback from people in the industry and we aren't selling anything yet.  We would love to pick your brain on this problem with a couple of emails.  This feedback will help us build a truly awesome and useful product, and by helping us you will be able to have a hand in building it!

And of course, everyone who gives feedback will be invited to be one of the first users of the product, before it's available to the public.  Talk about a competitive advantage!

We would love to hear back from you, the first thing we want to know is:
What is the first thing that you look for when you're evaluating a new opportunity?

Go ahead and reply with your response, we can't wait to hear from you!

Sincerely,
The EmeraldGov Team
