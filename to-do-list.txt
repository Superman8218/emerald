Table Fixes:
	navbar doesn't extend
	ajax querying
	The filter widgets aren't always suitable.  For example, filtering for owner shouldn't show a picklist of all the owners, but instead should show a textbox

Moderate Severity:
	Fbo Import
		Fix contact import
			The description gets tied up with the contacts sometimes
			RECURSION CAN BE USER HERE
		The description field can get all out of whack
		Look into archive date
		Setasides need their own choices

Ancillary activities:
	Set up (test) business email
	Develop terms and conditions
	Form an LLC
	Create a business bank account
	Get an EIN
	File 2016 taxes
