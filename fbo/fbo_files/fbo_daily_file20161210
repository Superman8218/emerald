<DESC>***THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS***<br /><br />This synopsis notice is posted in accordance with FAR Part 5.203(a).The U.S. Department of Education (Department) anticipates the solicitation and award of one hybrid contract (contains both Fixed Price and Cost Reimbursement Tasks) for a new Fiscal Year 2017 procurement titled " International Early Learning Study Pilot " (hereafter referred to as "iELS") on behalf of the Institute for Education Sciences (IES), National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). The requirement is a new initiative of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), an intergovernmental organization of industrialized countries. The iELS is managed by the OECD with guidance from participating countries (Early Learning Group of Countries) that meet regularly to provide input on the direction of the study. The anticipated contract is for the data collection in the United States that meets all international and NCES guidelines and that makes available on a timely basis high-quality internationally comparative assessment data. Furthermore, the study shall result in a report presenting U.S. data and the international comparisons from the perspective of an American constituency.  The Draft iELS Performance Work Statement (PWS) is attached for reference. <br /><br />The period of performance for the anticipated contract is 60 months in order to meet the international schedule for countries participating in iELS (a four-year international commitment) and to complete the post-study work required by NCES. Although the specific timeline of the study is still to be determined, it is expected that participating countries will field-test instruments and procedures in 2017 and 2018 (2017 in the United States) and will conduct the operational data collection in 2018 and 2019 (2018 in the United States). Results are scheduled to be reported in 2020. <br />The anticipated contract is non-severable as the four base tasks (and six optional tasks) will be carried out over the 60 months of the base contract. <br /> <br />The Department anticipates posting the iELS Request for Proposals on www.FBO.gov in mid-December 2016. It is anticipated that the acquisition strategy will be a negotiated, competitive acquisition (open to both small and large businesses) conducted in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15.<br /><br />All questions or comments concerning this notice or its contents must be directed to Gibran Mills, Contract Specialist, via EMAIL ONLY at Gibran.Mills@ed.gov&#894; with a carbon copy to Sylvia Thomas, Contracting Officer at Sylvia.Thomas@ed.gov.
