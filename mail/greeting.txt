I see that <Business> has been successful in the Federal IT services market.  You probably had some difficulties somewhere along the path to winning the contracts you have.  I've noticed that a lot of companies struggle with the fact that there are just so many opportunities in the IT services market that can be difficult to find the signal in the noise, especially when trying to find opportunities before the RFP stage, when it might already be too late to have a chance to win..  Have you noticed the same things? The reason I ask is I'm thinking of doing something to address this problem, and help companies find (and win) the opportunities that are right for them, without spending so much time sorting through opportunities that aren't right for them.  Anything you could share with me would be huge.  Thanks, and good luck winning more contracts!
