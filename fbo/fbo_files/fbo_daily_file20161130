It is critical that CDC staff must have access to the lodging that meets requirements established by the Department of State and to ensure that performance measures will be met to prevent any disruptions and allow the CDC presence to address potential flair ups, special projects or recovery efforts to the Ebola Viral Disease (EVD) epidemic. These services were previously performed under BOA # 200-2015-63007.
<p>There has been significant progress in reducing the spread of the Ebola virus in the three heavily affected countries due to collective efforts by CDC and partners around the world. Ebola eradication is the current goal and ongoing efforts to achieve this are at a critical stage as the Ebola Response efforts shift to recovery and Global Health Security. The three heavily affected countries in West Africa (Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia) remain a priority for this agenda. <br /><br />In order to maintain a stable prescence in Sierra Leone, the CDC requires space for an operational Country Office to support its team based in country and those that are on travel status in a safe and secure work environment. <br /><br />Due to the nature of this Ebola Viral Disease (EVD) requirement, services are considered to be available from only one source. The Radisson Blu Mammy Yoko Hotel, an U.S. Embassy approved hotel located in the capital of Freetown, Sierra Leone is the only vendor that meets requirements established by the Department of State, Diplomatic Security, Regional Security Office (RSO) and can provide us with these services on an expedited basis. <br /><br />The proposed contract action is for lodging, sleeping rooms and office space under NAICS 721110; for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of Other Than Full and Open Competition as authorized under FAR 6.302.<br /><br />The U.S. Government's requirements are:<br />&bull; Perimeter control access, with 24 hours guards and routine screening for all visitors for symptoms of Ebola Viral Disease (EVD)<br />&bull; Safe and secure lodging up to 100 staff<br />&bull; Office space for approximately 80 workstations<br />&bull; Office space for 10 to 12 people, for sensitive conversations or private meetings<br />&bull; Meeting and conference space that can accommodate approximately 100 staff. <br />&bull; Approximately 1,000 square feet of safe and secure storage for critical supplies and equipment<br />&bull; Space to park and load 50+ vehicles and store overnight, with a space to accommodate shelter for drivers, with bathroom and air conditioning<br />&bull; Safe and secure environment for CDC contracted drivers, protected from the elements, with air conditioners, and bathrooms, for approximately 20 drivers<br /><br />No solicitation is available and telephone requests for information will not be honored. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, the Government shall consider all responses received within fifteen calendar (15) days of this posting using the authority in 5.203 (a) for the acquisition of commercial items. A determination not to compete this requirement is based on market research and is solely within the discretion of the Government. This announcement is not a request for competitive quotations. All interested responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the CDC. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition of the work required would be advantageous to the Government.

Any such work will be executed as task orders issued against this contract by Contracting Officers of other Federal Government agencies or units within the Forest Service, and may not be located in the Madison, WI area. Estimated contract award date is on or about February 01, 2017.<br />A Source Selection Evaluation Board (SSEB), comprised of Forest Products Laboratory personnel, will evaluate the technical proposals. Offerors are advised that the technical evaluation and rating of proposals will be conducted in strict confidence. The number and identities of offerors are not revealed to anyone who is not involved in the evaluation and award process or to other offerors. <br />The evaluation process essentially consists of six parts: proposal compliance review and responsibility determination, technical/quality evaluation, Bio-Preferred Products, determination of competitive range, interviews/discussions with offerors of the top rated proposals, and ranking of technical proposals based on written submissions and results of discussions.<br /><br />1. Proposal Compliance Review: This is an initial review to ensure that all required forms and certifications are complete, the technical proposal was received, and that the offeror is both responsible and responsive to the RFP requirements.
<p>2. Technical/Quality Evaluation: The SSEB will evaluate and rate those proposals passing the first review, above. Proposals will be evaluated against the RFP requirements. Some factors will be rated using an adjectival-based system. Others will be rated on a "go, no-go" basis.</p>
<p>3. Bio-Preferred Products: Offeror must demonstrate that an effort is made to utilize bio-based products in its operations. Products can be found at www.biopreferred.gov. Technical proposals must demonstrate that offeror shall make an effort to utilize bio-based products in its operations. Technical proposal shall contain a list of products which vendor will make an effort <br />to utilize.</p>
<p>4. Determination of Competitive Range: The SSEB will rank offers based on Technical/Quality Evaluation conducted in M.2.4. The competitive range will not exceed the five top rated proposals, as determined by the SSEB.</p>
<p>5. Interviews/Discussions: The SSEB and SSA will conduct interviews with the offerors that are most highly qualified (competitive range), as determined by the SSEB in section M.2.5. The opportunity for an interview and further discussion of the offeror's capabilities will only be extended to the top five rated technical proposals submitted, that is, the competitive range. At the SSA's discretion, invitations for interviews may be extended beyond or reduced below the top five offerors, if the SSA finds this to be in the Government's best interest.</p>
<p>6. Interviews/Discussions: The SSEB and SSA will conduct interviews with the offerors that are most highly qualified (competitive range), as determined by the SSEB in section M.2.5. The opportunity for an interview and further discussion of the offeror's capabilities will only be extended to the top five rated technical proposals submitted, that is, the competitive range. At the SSA's discretion, invitations for interviews may be extended beyond or reduced below the top five offerors, if the SSA finds this to be in the Government's best interest.</p>
<p>An award will be made to the responsible, responsive offeror whose offer is determined to be the highest rated technical proposal, and whose negotiated rates are determined to be fair and reasonable by the Government. Firms responding to this announcement before the closing date will be considered for selection, subject to any limitations indicated with respect to size, geographic location of firm, specialized technical expertise, or other requirements listed. Following an initial evaluation of the qualification and performance data submitted, two or more firms that are considered to be the most highly qualified to provide the type of services required, will be chosen for negotiation of unit cost for task items such as corner search, monumentation, control measurement, etc.<br /><br />Please submit five (5) complete copies of the above information to: USDA Forest Service, Attn: Colleen Reittinger, 1 Gifford Pinchot Drive, Madison, WI 53726-2398.

<DESC>CABLEWAY REPAIR (NEW CABLE INSTALLATION)

This is a 100% small business set-aside construction project.  

The requirement is to reinstate our USGS cableway on the Clearwater River at Spalding, ID (Station ID 13342500).   The USGS Idaho Water Science Center (ID WSC) has had a cableway at this site for over 30 years. The cable was decommissioned (removed) back in 2010, and the existing cable was damaged during the removal and cannot be reused.  All of the cableway structures were left in place at that time. 

New cable for the cableway needs to be installed to restore this cableway to a functional state, and to enable the USGS to safely make streamflow measurements, collect suspended sediment, and bedload data in support of USGS and other agencies water science. 

Prospective contractors must be licensed general contractor in the State of Idaho.  Work location is Spaulding, ID and is not federal property.

See RFQ for additional details and requirements.

This contract task is to obtain depot level inspection and repair capabilities for the TH-1H helicopter. The USAF TH-1H helicopter is the result of three modifications to a refurbished UH-1H. The modifications include engine, drive train, structural, and rotor modifications as part of the Bell Model UH-lH II (Huey II) kit, as well as an avionics upgrade, glass cockpit displays, and crashworthy seat modifications. This aircraft is the USAF's primary rotary wing trainer and is based at Cairns Army Airfield, AL. The USAF currently plans on sending 3 or 4 aircraft for program depot maintenance per year.</span></p>

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal; TEXT-AUTOSPACE: ; mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">The primary purpose of the program for the TH-1H aircraft is to accomplish aircraft structural inspections concurrent with zonal inspections at a depth and skill level greater than that available at organizational and intermediate (O&amp;I) maintenance levels. The zonal inspections will address electrical wiring, hydraulic lines, connections, fuel system, fuel lines, and general integrity of the remaining items in that zone. Components are removed to the extent required to conduct detailed airframe inspection and will not normally be subject to any repair, and thus will not normally be the subject of any depot-level maintenance covered under this effort. However maintenance actions such as component-level rework or test, modifications or special inspections, may be required on an over-and-above basis with prior approval. Furthermore, depot teams may be sent to the field to accomplish inspections or repairs as required. The PDM program may also be responsible for repairing crash damaged aircraft. Aircraft involved in a mishap may be brought to the depot, with prior approval, to be returned to a flyable condition. Performance requirements are detailed within the TH-1H DLM Work Specification. This document defines the general zones required for inspection, certain structural items to be inspected, and subsystems required for program depot maintenance. This document also requires the contractor to provide engineering assistance when required to develop structural repairs, with government coordination.</span></p>

Finally, depot maintenance at the field level (deployment of depot field teams (DFT)) on an as needed basis is required.</span></p>

<DESC>THIS IS A Sources Sought Notice ONLY. <br />The US Government currently intends to extend the period of performance for Contract Number W9124Q-07-C-0504 for a six (6) period from 1 December 2016 through 30 June 2017. The six (6) month extension of service clause FAR 52.217-8, "Option to Extend Services" is in the current contract. However, this option period under FAR 52.217-8 was not previously evaluated as part of the initial contract award. An extension is required to maintain continuity of services.
<p>Accordingly, in order to exercise the clause and extend services for an additional six (6) months, the contract action must fall within the ambit of a proper sole-source contract action under FAR Part 6.3. The proposed six (6) months extension for Contract W9124Q-07-C-0504 under the provisions of statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements, will be extended on a sole source basis to TRAX International, LLC, 8337 West Sunset Rd, Ste. 250, Las Vegas, NV 89113-2200, for the Mission Support Services (MSS) contract at White Sands Missile Range (WSMR), New Mexico. The estimated dollar value of this action is $42 million.</p>
<p>The proposed six (6) month sole source extension under contract W9124Q-07-C-0504, is for the Army Test &amp; Evaluation Command (ATEC) to provide engineering and technical services to support operation and developmental testing for Department of Defense (DoD) program offices at White Sands Missile Range (WSMR) and on occasion, at various US and overseas locations. These services consist of augmentation of the Government workforce across the functional areas of WSMR capabilities. Support ranges from operating and maintaining range instrumentation (radar, optics, telemetry, timing...), evaluation of systems under test, development and modernization of range instrumentation systems, flight safety analysis and software engineering.</p>
<p>In response to this sources sought, please provide:</p>
<p>1. Identify any condition or action that may be having the effect of unnecessarily restricting competition with respect to this acquisition and identify alternatives or solutions. Also contact the MICC Advocate for Competition, Scott Kukes, at scott.d.kukes.civ@mail.mi l or 210-466-2269, if you believe that this action is unreasonably restricting competition. Include the subject of the acquisition, this announcement, and the MICC POC information from the Sources Sought Synopsis. Provide the specific aspects that unreasonably restrict competition and the rationale for such conclusion.</p>
<p>2. Name of the firm, point of contact, phone number, email address, DUNS number, CAGE code, identify business size (large business or a small business), and if applicable, a statement regarding small business status (including small business type(s)/certifications(s) such as SDB, 8(a), HUBZone, SDVOSB, WOSB, etc.) and the corresponding NAICS code.</p>
<p>3. Identify whether your firm is interested in competing for a follow-on requirement as a prime contractor or not. Identify subcontracting, joint ventures or teaming arrangement that will be pursued, if any.</p>

<DESC>This project will replace AHU-6A and AHU-7A, which serve the UPS room in the mechanical wing. The existing ducts and chilled water piping will be modified to accommodate the new air handlers and to allow maintenance access. The heat load generated by the equipment in the room has changed since the HVAC system was designed and must be revised to meet the current demand. The new AHUs may require variable speed drives to manage the unusual heat load of the space. Low speed operation will allow for humidity control, and high speed operation will provide higher cooling capacity needed when the UPSs are put through their scheduled maintenance load tests.

The design of the water proofing system used to protect the UPS equipment from potential water leaks will be evaluated.  The equipment curbs, insulation, and damaged rubber membrane will be replaced. Demolition activities will remove all previous hangers, supports, and brackets, along with abandoned pipes and conduits in the space. Lighting in the mechanical space will be relocated, to provide safe and effective work areas for maintenance operations and daily inspections.

The TS facility clearance shall be maintained throughout the performance period. 

Attention interested parties: 

Interested parties are invited to confirm their applicable business characteristics with regard to item 1) above and additionally: confirm or comment on the likelihood of being positioned to satisfy items 2) and 3) above.
 Additionally, questions, suggestions and comments on matters related to this notice may be submitted. The Government intends for such response from interested parties to provide a means of industry participation in Market Research to assist in determining our acquisition strategy for the Advanced Ocean Warfare Center (EXWC).

Program area and the intended acquisition: 

Advanced Ocean Technologies Program (AOTP) of the Naval Facilities Engineering Command (NAVFAC) Engineering and Expeditionary Warfare Center (EXWC)is the program area. The scope of the intended single-award IDIQ contract is described below.    

The primary purpose of AOTP is to conduct research and develop ocean engineering and naval architecture solutions in support of design, installation, operation and maintenance of both fixed ocean systems and towed systems.
 This work is conducted on both ships of opportunity and the Motor Vessel INDEPENDENCE (MVI). EXWCâ€™s Capital Improvements Ocean Facilities Department (CIOFP) conducts research, development, testing and evaluation in specific areas. These areas include (1) the study of the physical characteristics and the design and construction of buoyant structuresâ€”including construction and operation of mechanical equipment of these structures; (2) ocean engineering associated with fixed structures on the seafloor; (3) underwater excavation, drilling, tunneling, and earth moving; (4) equipment and tools for underwater construction; (5) ocean current measurement systems and other engineering sensors; (6) underwater power sources; (7) electrical power distribution equipment and transmission systems; and (8) surface and underwater load handling systems.
 Additionally, AOTP enables EXWC to apply these technologies to assist other government agencies in ocean platform support, remotely operated vehicle (ROV) operations, and search, location, and recovery operations, for a wide spectrum of purposes. To increase the effectiveness of underwater work conducted by the United States military, EXWC is actively engaged in an integrated program of technology and equipment development with the central goal to provide improved tools and work technique, AOTP supports this EXWC effort. 

The engineering and technical support solutions for projects and programs within AOTP may require the skill sets in the general areas identified below. Each specific requirement to be fulfilled will be specified in a request for task order proposal (RFTOP), as issued during the period of performance for the planned contract.
 That contract is planned as an indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract which will be a single-award contract: one contractor only.

        Skill Sets

a.	Naval Architecture
b.	System Engineering/Integrated Logistics Support
c.	Marine Geotechnical Engineering
d.	Marine Corrosion/Marine Materials Engineering
e.	Ocean Engineering
f.	Electrical/Electronics Engineering
g.	Mechanical/Hydraulic Engineering, Design, and     Drafting
h.	Software Engineering 
i.	Marine Heavy Load Handling Systems
j.	Shipboard Deployment and Recovery Handling
k.	Environmental Permitting
l.	Marine Research Design Technology
m.	Marine Equipment Technical and Logistics Support
n.	Offshore Systems Installation and Performance Monitoring

Special considerations:
 
Note that in regard to item n.
 above, a task order may require the contractor to assist the Government by providing a suitable vessel configured to perform ROV operations and object recovery operations and will coordinate vessel schedule and planning of offshore operations. In addition to the skill sets identified above, engineering design, design analysis and review, prototype fabrication, system testing/integration, computer hardware/software development, as well as technical manual production and documentation are possible focal areas for requirements within task orders to be issued under an AOTP IDIQ contract.

Onsite performance at NAVFAC EXWC, located on Naval Base Ventura County (NBVC) in Port Hueneme, California, will be a requirement of many, if not all, AOTP task orders.
 Offsite performance at other government locations and contractor facilities is typically required by some AOTP task orders. In conjunction with onsite performance, the contractor may sometimes be required to arrive in-person at NBVC within a half-day (four-hour) response time. The specific requirement may be expressed in the IDIQ contract solicitation as a requirement for a contractor to maintain an office within a minimal commuting distance, such as within a radius of 120 miles for onsite proximity. This requirement of reasonable geographic proximity aligns with item 2) in the purpose statement at the beginning of this notice.
 
While the nature of the AOTP work and the information it entails may be designated in task orders as SECRET, an AOTP requirement pertinent to Top Secret (TS) will be included in the request for proposal (RFP) and resulting single-award IDIQ contract.
 The Governmentâ€™s TS requirement is consistent with the information provided in item 3) of the purpose statement above.

Duration of IDIQ contract for AOTP:

The contract term will provide a base ordering period of 60 months. Additionally, an option period of six months to extend the ordering period may be included in the solicitation and resulting award, with the pricing of that option period therefore included in the evaluation of proposals received by the Government in response to a solicitation for the IDIQ contract. An option to extend is only exercised at the sole discretion of the Contracting Officer. Task orders issued during the period of performance for the IDIQ contract will constitute a follow-on to the existing program, which has had a series of IDIQ contracts and associated task orders awarded in prior years.
 
Pricing arrangement for the planned IDIQ contract:

Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) is the planned pricing arrangement.
 A CPFF proposal will be a required submittal alongside a technical proposal when the solicitation for an IDIQ contract is issued; details will be provided therein.  
Each request for task order proposal issued to the party awarded the IDIQ contract will entail submittal of a task-specific cost proposal, alongside a task-specific technical proposal.
 
Small Business considerations:

The proposed IDIQ contract described herein is being considered for a 100 percent set-aside for small business (SB).

<DESC>U.S. GOVERNMENT is seeking competitive lease proposals for new and/or continuing leasing opportunities through the Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP) in December.   <br /> <br />HOW TO OFFER: The Government will use its Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP), located at https://aaap.gsa.gov. The AAAP will enable interested parties to offer space for lease to the Federal Government for future projects.  The offer submission process is entirely web-based and allows registered participants to submit and update offers based on a Request for Lease Proposals (RLP) within a specified time frame referred to as the &lsquo;Open Period'.  Interested parties must go to the AAAP website, select the "Register to Offer Space" link and follow the instructions to register.  Instructional guides and video tutorials are offered on the AAAP homepage and in the "HELP" tab on the AAAP website. Once registered, interested parties may enter offers during the &lsquo;Open Period'.<br /> <br />The Open Period for December is December 1, 2016 to December 7, 2016, ending at 11:59 p.m. EST.  The AAAP will be used to award leases of no less than 500 ANSI/BOMA Office Area (ABOA) square feet (SF) to satisfy new requirements and/or compete existing leases for potential replacement.  The Government reserves the right to award more than the 500 ABOA SF minimum mentioned herein, to make multiple awards, and/or combine multiple space requirements.  Building/ space specifications and offer terms and conditions are contained in the RLP and related documents posted on the website (https://aaap.gsa.gov).  Specific requirements will be identified after the close of the Open Period. Lease awards will be made to the lowest price, technically acceptable offer, without negotiations, based upon the RLP requirements package found on the AAAP website.  During an Open Period, offerors will be permitted to keep current offers, modify or withdraw those offers.  <br /> <br />This RLP is effective immediately and will apply to all requirements competed through the AAAP program through the remainder of FY 2017 or until it is replaced.
<p><br />* If you have previously submitted an offer in FY 2016, the AAAP application has a copy feature which will allow existing offers to be copied over to the FY 2017 RLP in order to avoid having to re-enter all of the data manually. Please be sure to review FY17 AAAP RLP Package and  each page within the AAAP Application prior to submitting your offer as some of the questions have changed. You must re-enter your space and rates on the &lsquo;Space and Rates' tab in the AAAP. Your previous offered space will not be copied.</p>
<p><br />DELINEATED AREA: All properties offered to the Government pursuant to the RLP Number 17-Reg09 and must be located within Region 9.</p>
<p><br />To view the states and territories within the region, refer to http://www.gsa.gov/portal/category/22227.</p>
<p><br />Delineated areas are clarified further in the RLP posted on the AAAP website and may be restricted further when specific space requirements are developed.</p>
<p><br />LEASE TERM:  Up to 15 years.</p>

<DESC>Solicitation Number: <br />W912GB-17-X-0020
<p>Notice Type: <br />Sources Sought - FY15 Israel MATOC - On Ramp Procedures</p>
<p>Synopsis:</p>
<p>This is a Sources Sought Synopsis announcement for information only, to be used for preliminary planning purposes. No proposals are being requested or accepted with this synopsis. This is not a solicitation or a Request for Proposal (RFP) and no contract shall be awarded from this synopsis. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Europe District (EUD) anticipates the issuance of a Request for Proposal the 1st Quarter of CY2017 and the potential award of additional contracts under the FY15 Israel Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC) On-Ramp procured during the 2nd Quarter of CY2017. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this sources sought or any follow up information requests.</p>
<p>The purpose of this synopsis is to gain knowledge of interest, capabilities and qualifications of interested construction firms who have the capabilities to complete and perform a contract of this magnitude, and to address any questions, recommendations, or concerns from Industry.</p>
<p>Background of FY15 Israel MATOC IDIQ On-Ramp: <br /><br />Currently the Israel FMS Construction Program has $400,000,000 in on-going construction projects and $165,000,000 in Pre-award actions. The Program projects approximately thirty (30) $1M to $15M additional task orders on the FY15 Israel MATOC over the next 36 months.</p>
<p>The FY15 Israel MATOC contract permits bringing on additional United States Contractor(s) under the On-Ramp procedures as planned for in the original Indefinite Deliver Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Solicitation W012GB-14-R-0030.</p>
<p>The FY15 Israel MATOC at award was a $249.5M construction IDIQ with a base year ($49.9M) and four (4) option years ($49.9M each). Six (6) contracts were awarded on 18 Jun 2015. The contracts are currently in Option Year 1 with Option Year 2 to be exercised in Jun 2017. The number of current active contracts is five (5).</p>
<p>The On-Ramp procedures as provided in the initial solicitation and contracts awarded are:</p>
<p>"The Government reserves the right to re-open competition at any time during the term of the contract. The KO intends to periodically review the need for additional Contractors during the contract period of performance (PoP). If it is determined to be in the Government's best interest to add Contractors, an on-ramp may be executed. When an on-ramp is used, the Government will advertise the reopening of the competition on FedBizOpps. All new awardees shall meet the criteria established in the initial solicitation. The evaluation and selection of awardees for any on-ramp will be the same as the evaluation and award criteria used for the initial basic contract awards. The anticipated number of awards will be announced in the reopening announcement posted to FedBizOpps; however the PCO has the discretion to award more or fewer contracts than the number anticipated in the solicitation depending upon the quality of the offers received."</p>
<p>"Any Contractor that received a basic contract award shall not re-compete. The new awardee(s) will compete with any existing or remaining Contractors for all task orders. Any additions due to on-ramps will not impact the contract ceiling. The ordering period for new awardees will not extend the overall maximum term of the original contract, nor shall it re-establish the contract base period. The new awardee(s) will be eligible to compete for future task order requests for proposal issued against the basic IDIQ contract. The Government will not consider unsolicited request for additional Contractors."</p>
<p>Description of Services: The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Europe District may conduct a competitive procurement with the intent to award two (2) or more additional Firm-Fixed Priced (FFP) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Multiple Award Task Order Contracts (MATOC) under the FY 15 Israel MATOC On-Ramp procedures for the purpose of providing repair, maintenance and construction services for Israeli Ministry of Defense facilities in Israel. The Government intends to evaluate and select, for contract award, an additional two (2) or more qualified Offeror(s), whose Proposal(s) are determined to be the most beneficial to the Government, with consideration given to both the technical evaluation factors and price. The current contract has estimated magnitude of $150,000,000.00 remaining with Option Year 1 on-going through 17 Jun 2017 and Option Years 2, 3 and 4 remaining. Each Option Year is $49.9M. The North American Industrial Classification System Code (NAICS) is 236220. Within the scope of the contract, the Government also intends to procure repair, maintenance and construction services for projects which may require a security clearance as detailed in this announcement. Task order request for proposals for projects which involve a security clearance will be restricted to those contractors which meet the requirements at the time of the task order proposal submission.</p>
<p>Foreign Military Sales Requirement: The majority of work will be administered under Foreign Military Sales (FMS), and United States procurement laws and regulations will apply.

The Security Clearance Requirements are anticipated to be the following:</p>

To be clear, a US Contractor, who at the time of award of an On-Ramp contract, that <br />does not hold an approved Secret Facility Clearance may obtain one during the life of the contract and thus be eligible for these projects.</p>
<p>2.) Any contractor who for any reason does not hold an approved Secret FCL at the time of issuance of a task order RFP will not be permitted to receive the RFP documents and submit a proposal.</p>
<p>3.) The specific security requirements will be task order dependent and provided for in the Special Contract Requirements (SRs) document with the task order RFP.<br /><br />Solicitation:<br />The intended solicitation will consist of a two (2) phase design-build selection procedure; Phase I - Pre-Qualification of Offerors and Phase II - Requests for Proposals from Pre-Qualified Offerors.</p>

<p>Phase II - Requests for Proposals from Pre-Qualified Offerors<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; * Design Capability<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;* Price</p>
<p>Those Offerors determined to be pre-qualified will be issued a formal Request for Proposal (RFP) for Phase II. The RFP will include additional contractual requirements which the offeror will review in order to prepare a technical and price proposal.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Coast Guard Surface Forces Logistics Center, Medium Endurance Cutter Product Line, has a requirement for the purchase of Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), Escher-Wyss, Controllable Pitch Propeller (CPP) Hubs, miscellaneous spare parts for hub overhaul, and the overhaul of hubs.
<p>These supplies and services are required for the CPP hubs on U.S. Coast Guard 270' WMEC "A &amp; B" class cutters. The Coast Guard does not possess the proprietary technical specifications, drawings, manufacturing/provisioning data, or special tools necessary to provide these supplies or training. This information was not purchased at the time of the original acquisition and is proprietary to the OEM, Escher Wyss.

Registration with Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System 
As prescribed in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 42.15, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) evaluates Contractor past performance on all contracts that exceed $150,000, and shares those evaluations with other Federal Government contract specialists and procurement officials.Â  The FAR requires that the Contractor be provided an opportunity to comment on past performance evaluations prior to each report closing.Â  To fulfill this requirement VA uses an online database, CPARS, which is maintained by the Naval Seal Logistics Center in Portsmouth, New Hampshire.Â  CPARS has connectivity with the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) database, which is available to all Federal agencies. PPIRS is the system used to collect and retrieve performance assessment reports used in source selection determinations and completed CPARS report cards transferred to PPIRS.Â  CPARS also includes access to the federal awardee performance and integrity information system (FAPIIS).Â  FAPIIS is a web-enabled application accessed via CPARS for Contractor responsibility determination information.
Each Contractor whose contract award is estimated to exceed $150,000 requires a CPARS evaluation.Â Â Â  A government Focal Point will register your contract within thirty days after contract award and, at that time, you will receive an email message with a User ID (to be used when reviewing evaluations).Â Â  Additional information regarding the evaluation process can be found at www.cpars.gov or if you have any questions, you may contact the Customer Support Desk @ DSN: 684-1690 or COMM: 207-438-1690. 
For contracts with a period of one year or less, the contracting officer will perform a single evaluation when the contract is complete.Â  For contracts exceeding one year, the contracting officer will evaluate the Contractor s performance annually.Â  Interim reports will be filed each year until the last year of the contract, when the final report will be completed.Â  The report shall be assigned in CPARS to the Contractor s designated representative for comment.Â  The Contractor representative will have sixty (60) days to submit any comments and re-assign the report to the CO.
Failure for the Contractor s representative to respond to the evaluation within those sixty (60)  days, will result in the Government s evaluation being placed on file in the database with a statement that the Contractor failed to respond; the Contractor s representative will be  locked out  of the evaluation and may no longer send comments.Â  
GOVERNMENT RESPONSIBILITIES
VA Support Personnel, Services or Equipment:  The physician will use an available desktop computer in the ICU or Outpatient Clinic for clinical purposes.  Standard administrative and nursing staff will be available for support as required.

In the event the Contractor effects any such change at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer without authority, no adjustment shall be made in the contract price to cover an increase in costs incurred as a result thereof. 
In the event that contracted services do not meet quality and/or safety expectations, the best remedy will be implemented, to include but not limited to a targeted and time limited performance improvement plan; increased monitoring of the contracted services; consultation or training for Contractor personnel to be provided by the VA; replacement of the contract personnel and/or renegotiation of the contract terms or termination of the contract.

The COR will review this data monthly when invoices are received and certify all invoices for payment by comparing the hours documented on the VA record-keeping system and those on the invoices.  Any evidence of the Contractor's non-compliance as evidenced by the monitoring procedures shall be forwarded immediately to the Contracting Officer.

Payment Adjustments/Performance Related Payment Deductions:
 Invoices will be prorated for partial days/hours worked.  The contractor shall be paid only for actual work performed onsite.  In the event that the Contract provider works a portion of an hour, the government may adjust payments by 15 minute increments. Contract providers shall be responsible for reporting time worked accurately. The Contract shall be paid for actual hours performed. 
The contract shall be adjusted at the end of the performance period in accordance with actual performance.

Performance Deductions: If the contractor fails to meet the Acceptable Quality Level on any performance measure that references a deduction as a disincentive, the following method for calculating and applying the deduction shall be employed:
 In the event of a physician no-show for duty, the Contractor will be liable for the costs associated with finding a suitable replacement for the shift or other period of absence.
Payments in full/no billing VA beneficiaries: The Contractor shall accept payment for services rendered under this contract as payment in full. VA beneficiaries shall not under any circumstances be charged nor their insurance companies charged for services rendered by the Contractor, even if VA does not pay for those services.  This provision shall survive the termination or ending of the contract.  
To the extent that the Veteran desires services which are not a VA benefit or covered under the terms of this contract, the Contractor must notify the Veteran that there will be a charge for such service and that the VA will not be responsible for payment. 
The Contractor shall not bill, charge, collect a deposit from, seek compensation, remuneration, or reimbursement from, or have any recourse against, any person or entity other than VA for services provided pursuant to this contract.  It shall be considered fraudulent for the Contractor to bill other third party insurance sources (including Medicare) for services rendered to Veteran enrollees under this contract. 
Contractor Security Requirements (Handbook 6500.6)   
6.7.1  General
 6.7.2  Contractors, contractor personnel, subcontractors, and subcontractor personnel shall be subject to the same Federal laws, regulations, standards, and VA Directives and Handbooks as VA and VA personnel regarding information and information system security. 

6.7.3  ACCESS TO VA INFORMATION AND VA INFORMATION SYSTEMS 

6.7.4  A contractor/subcontrator shall request logical (technical) or physical access to VA information and VA information systems for their employees, subcontractors, and affiliates only to the extent necessary to perform the services specified in the contract, agreement, or task order. 

6.7.5  All contractors, subcontractors, and third-party servicers and associates working with VA information are subject to the same investigative requirements as those of VA appointees or employees who have access to the same types of information. The level and process of background security investigations for contractors must be in accordance with VA Directive and Handbook 0710, Personnel Suitability and Security Program. The Office for Operations, Security, and Preparedness is responsible for these policies and procedures. 
6.7.6 Contract personnel who require access to national security programs must have a valid security clearance. National Industrial Security Program (NISP) was established by Executive Order 12829 to ensure that cleared U.S. defense industry contract personnel safeguard the classified information in their possession while performing work on contracts, programs, bids, or research and development efforts. The Department of Veterans Affairs does not have a Memorandum of Agreement with Defense Security Service (DSS). Verification of a Security Clearance must be processed through the Special Security Officer located in the Planning and National Security Service within the Office of Operations, Security, and Preparedness. 
6.7.7 Custom software development and outsourced operations must be located in the U.S. to the maximum extent practical. If such services are proposed to be performed abroad and are not disallowed by other VA policy or mandates, the contractor/subcontractor must state where all non-U.S. services are provided and detail a security plan, deemed to be acceptable by VA, specifically to address mitigation of the resulting problems of communication, control, data protection, and so forth. Location within the U.S. may be an evaluation factor. 
6.7.8 The contractor or subcontractor must notify the Contracting Officer immediately when an employee working on a VA system or with access to VA information is reassigned or leaves the contractor or subcontractor s employ.   The Contracting Officer must also be notified immediately by the contractor or subcontractor prior to an unfriendly termination.

This requirement is for the sustainment/maintenance of a Biological Surety Program that is compliant with DoD Biological Select Agents and Toxins Regulations to support the ongoing mission of the Joint Vaccine Acquisition Program (JVAP).
<p>This is a follow-on contract for the continued provision of highly specialized services. The service provided under this contract is for the sustainment/maintenance of a Biological Surety Program that is compliant with DoD Biological Select Agents and Toxins Regulations to support the ongoing mission of the Joint Vaccine Acquisition Program (JVAP). This Biological Surety Program will include a Biological Personnel Reliability Program (BPRP) and is subject to routine Department of the Army Inspector General (DAIG) rated inspections and Surety Management Reviews. Activities to be conducted to support maintenance of the BPRP Program include: training, annual and ongoing medical evaluations, BSAT inventory, Badging, Hosting Audits, BSAT Security equipment maintenance, Emergency Response Drills, and annual vulnerability assessments.</p>
<p>IITRI is the only company that has the necessary, validated, plague assays needed for the current ongoing Biological Surety Program, and is the only facility that has the validated mouse potency assay needed to release the plague vaccine final drug product. Transferring these assays to another BSAT compliant facility would be considered a duplication of effort and would significantly impact the program schedule, thereby delaying FDA Approval.</p>
<p>This is a notice of intent to issue this solicitation on a sole source basis. This notice of intent is not a request for quotations (RFQ). Any other firms desiring consideration must fully identify their interest and capability to provide these items no later than December 30th, 2016 to the individual listed below.

<DESC>FBO ANNOUNCEMENT: PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE, NOTICE OF INTENT
<p>ACTION CODE: SPECIAL NOTICE</p>
<p>CLASSIFICATION CODE: 66 - Instruments and Laboratory Equipment</p>
<p>SUBJECT: Membership to NumFocus on behalf of Software Carpentry Foundation &amp; Data Carpentry</p>
<p>PURCHASE NUMBER: NB641000-17-00453</p>
<p>RESPONSE DATE: 9 AM ET on 12/12/2016</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION:<br />The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1) using Simplified Acquisition Procedures, with NumFocus, located at P.O. Box 90596 Austin, TX 78709 to purchase training memberships for a twelve-month base period and four twelve-month optional periods in two non-profit organizations that support and promote world class, innovative, open source scientific computing projects.</p>
<p>The sole source justification is based on the following: NIST's Material Measurement Laboratory's Office of Data and Informatics (ODI) is a premier, pioneering resource for researchers and institutions in the Materials Chemical, and Biological sciences who need to leverage both large and information-rich data sets now common in many disciplines. To continue its efforts to fulfill NIST's mission, ODI requires membership in professional organizations, specifically the Software Carpentry Foundation and Data Carpentry Organization, which aim to teach concepts, skills, and tools for working more effectively with data, and to help scientists be more productive by learning highly specialized computing skills. Membership into the Software Carpentry Foundation and Data Carpentry can only be obtained through NumFOCUS Inc. NIST has determined that the expenditure would further the authorized activities of the agency; and this determination is not affected by any incidental benefits that may accrue to individual employees.</p>
<p>The membership fulfills the following NIST requirements:<br />1. Reservation of six (6) seats per year in an online instructor led training course.<br />2. Ability for NIST to self-organize unlimited internal software workshops with no additional workshop fees.<br />3. Organization of up to four (4) workshops at NIST Gaithersburg Campus, including: <br />&bull; Coordinating with NIST to identify instructors with requisite skills/experience for workshop's subject matter. All instructors must be certified by either the Software Carpentry foundation or Data Carpentry Organization.<br />&bull; Developing subject matter presentation content for the workshops.</p>
<p>Market research has shown that NumFocus, on behalf of the Software Carpentry Foundation and Data Carpentry, is the sole organization that can provide such membership, as they are the only professional organizations that support open source scientific computing, and promote sustainable high-level programming languages, open source code developments, and reproducible scientific research.</p>
<p>There is no other organization that provides the kind of instructional materials that Software Carpentry Foundation offers. They are deliberately operating-system and applications-program agnostic. They focus on commonly used and mostly open source software tools such as Unix, Git and GitHub, Python, and R, though they also run workshops for users of SQL databases and MATLAB. They bring a unique perspective to training of researchers that does not promote a particular vendor's software or hardware platform. This approach is especially important for researchers at NIST, where staff utilize a wide variety of software and hardware configurations. Similarly, Data Carpentry is a partner organization that focuses on training programs in data management, curation, visualization, and analytics. Membership allows full access to all their resources. Like Software Carpentry Foundation, Data Carpentry is operating-system and applications-program agnostic, which is a key requirement for NIST's researchers.</p>
<p>Given these facts, Numfocus is determined to be the only source reasonably available to provide the required membership and training.</p>
<p>The resulting purchase order will be a Firm Fixed Price order. The NAICS is 813920 with a size standard of 15 million dollars.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested parties who regard themselves as capable of fulfilling these requirements are invited to submit responses to the Government for consideration. Responses received by 11:00am EST 12/12/2016, will be considered by the Government.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government to no compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<SUBJECT>LX(R) Original Equipment Manufacturer Industry Day
<SOLNBR>N00024-16-R-2448
<CONTACT>Lawrence J. Gordin, Contracting Officer, Email lawrence.gordin@navy.mil
<DESC>This Special Notice is for the purpose of announcing that Program Executive Office, Ships (PMS 317) intends to conduct an Industry Day event for LX(R) Amphibious Ship Replacement Program prospective Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania October 5-6, 2016. <br />Background:
<p>The LX(R) program will build a new class of 11 amphibious ships for the Navy, with intended first procurement in FY2020. LX(R)s are to replace 12 aging Whidbey Island/Harpers Ferry (LSD-41/49) class amphibious ships, the first of which will reach age 40 in 2025. The design of the LX(R) is to be derived from the design of the Navy's San Antonio (LPD-17) class amphibious ships.</p>
<p>The primary function of Navy amphibious ships is to lift (i.e., transport) U.S. Marines and their equipment and supplies to distant operating areas, and enable Marines to conduct expeditionary operations ashore in those areas. Although amphibious ships are designed to support Marine landings against opposing military forces, they are also used for operations throughout the range of military operations.</p>
<p>The Navy is focused on affordability and schedule acceleration for ship design and construction of the LX(R) program. The Navy understands the value of shipbuilding industry participation to better understand the major cost and quality drivers, discover cost reduction / avoidance opportunities, and refine cost estimates.</p>
<p>Industry Day Information:</p>
<p>The LX(R) Industry Day event intends to facilitate an open discussion between the Navy (PMS317), shipyards (HII and NASSCO), and potential systems suppliers, communicate the objectives of the program, and conduct technical discussions on system requirements. OEM system suppliers will be expected to contribute to open dialogue and propose improvement ideas to the Navy's Program Office.</p>
<p>Dedicated one-on-one workshops with the program office will provide an additional opportunity to address ship specifications that drive cost and complexity.</p>
<p>Additional information about the structure of Technical Workshops will be provided with registration confirmations.</p>
<p>The LX(R) OEM Industry Day event will be held at the Philadelphia Navy Yard Building 77L, 1000 Kitty Hawk Avenue, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19112. The following events are tentatively scheduled as follows:</p>
<p>General Session:<br />Date: October 5, 2016<br />Time: 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM EST<br /><br />Technical Workshops and Affordability Discussions:<br />Date: October 5, 2016<br />Time: 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM EST</p>
<p>Date: October 6, 2016<br />Time: 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM EST</p>
<p>While the OEM Industry Day is open to all potential suppliers for LX(R), the preliminary agenda will include detailed Technical Workshops on the below targeted systems. These systems are subject to change and will be finalized after registration closes.</p>
<p>&bull; Valves, Pumps and Motors to include Control/Regulating Valves (motor operated and pneumatic valves)<br />&bull; Mission Systems to include Cranes, Doors, Elevators, Bridge Cranes, Electric Anchor Windlass &amp; Mooring Capstans (Commercialized), and Well Deck synthetic batter board/decking material<br />&bull; Electrical Distribution to include Cable, Power Panels, Transformers, Switchgear, Electric Plant Controls, and Lighting<br />&bull; Forgings, Castings, and Shafting<br />&bull; HVAC Systems and Components<br />&bull; Auxiliary Systems to include Reverse Osmosis Units and Modular Reefers<br />&bull; Controllable Pitch Propeller<br />&bull; Modular Installations</p>
<p>Registration:</p>
<p>This event is only open to United States citizens. A United States citizen is defined as a person that is a natural-born citizen within the United States or a person that was admitted lawfully into the United States for permanent residence.</p>
<p>The registration form is attached to this announcement. Attendees must include a copy of a valid DD Form 2345 (Military Critical Technical Data Agreement) with their registration submission. A valid DD Form 2345 can be found at: http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/forms/eforms/dd2345.pdf</p>
<p>During registration, each supplier may request a section of the DRAFT Ship Specifications to facilitate better understanding of the Navy's requirements and to encourage Industry development of affordability and complexity reduction ideas.</p>
<p>Suppliers may also request a separate individual meeting to facilitate an Affordability Discussion with the LX(R) Program Office and present cost reduction or spec improvement ideas. These sessions will be scheduled based on availability.</p>
<p>Please submit completed registration packages no later than 5:00 PM EST on September 23, 2016 to the POC identified below.

<DESC>California Fuel Cell Partnership 

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to purchase on a sole source basis a membership with the California Fuel Cell Partnership (CaFCP) through Bevilacqua-Knight, Inc (BKI).  The CaFCP is a voluntary public/private organization that provides advancing automotive fuel cell technology to help move the world toward practical and affordable environmental solutions through a unique collaboration of auto manufacturers, energy companies, fuel cell companies, the State of California, and various Federal Agencies. The acquisition of this Commercial item will be subject under the authority of FAR Part 13.106-1(b).  This requirement will utilize FAR Parts 12 and 13, Commercial and Simplified Acquisition Procedures. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541620 Environmental Consulting Services with a small business size of $15,000,000.00.
	
The CaFCP is focused on advancing automotive fuel cell technology to help move the world toward practical and affordable environmental solutions.  Through the CaFCP, automobile companies, fuel suppliers, government entities, and others can come together to facilitate the demonstration of fuel cell vehicles under real day-to-day driving conditions.  As a member of the CaFCP, the EPA will participate and share in the information and experiences generated through the collaborative activities of its various members. The benefits of membership encompass opportunities to build relationships with all key stakeholders in the fuel cell dialog.

The CaFCP selected BKI based on its unique qualifications in administering vehicle demonstration programs.  Because CaFCP cannot enter into contracts, governmental entities pay their membership dues to BKI, who manages the funds under the direction of the CaFCP Steering Committee and who provides management services to facilitate and coordinate the cooperative efforts of the CaFCP, including operational, financial, contract, and project management services.    

CaFCP/BKI is the only known source able to satisfy this requirement. THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION.  However, any firm believing itself capable of providing membership services with CaFCP may submit technical documentation to establish their capability.  Such documentation must be submitted to the Contracting Officer within 15 calendar days of electronic posting of this notice.  A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon responses received will normally be considered solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.  Documentation should be submitted in writing to Angela Lower via email at lower.angela@epa.gov.  Telephone responses will not be honored. Award estimated date is January 1, 2016.

BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION:

In accordance with 25 U.S.C. 3201 (P.L. 101-630), Indian Child Protection and Family Violence Prevention Act; 42 U.S.C. 13041, Crime Control Act of 1990; 441 Departmental Manual, Personnel Security and Suitability Requirements all positions with duties and responsibilities involving regular contact with or control over Indian children are subject to a background investigation and determination of suitability for employment.

Accordingly, all such positions require a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination made by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Office of Indian Education Programs (OIEP), Personnel Security and Suitability Program; and a favorable background investigation determination conducted by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).

A favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination must be made by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Office of the Indian Education Programs (OIEP), Personnel Security and Suitability Program prior to contract award or made within 60 days of incorporation of this clause into a current/existing contract. Pending completion of a background investigation by OPM, the Contractor who has been granted a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination must be within the sight and under the supervision of a Government employee who has had a completed background investigation (42 U.S.C 13041 (3)) during contract performance until a final background investigation determination has been made.

Prior employment with the Federal Government, including BIA, OIEP or the Bureau of Indian Affairs, does not assure that the appropriate screening or investigation was conducted nor does it alleviate or guarantee a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination or background investigation.

Prior to an award or during the 60 day period discussed in paragraph two, it is solely the company, individual or contractor's responsibility to contact the BIA, OIEP Personnel Security and Suitability Program at 505-563-5287/5288/5289/5294 in order to obtain a complete security package, which includes but is not limited to appropriate investigative forms and/or inquire about their previous investigation; and, obtain a screening (applicant and suitability) determination, and subsequent final background investigation.

If an unfavorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination is made, a purchase order shall not be awarded to the individual who received an unfavorable screening or to the company who has proposed to employ the individual to perform the work. The individual and or the company who proposed to employ this individual may be determined to be non-responsible if an unfavorable screening (applicant and suitability) determinations is made, which will make them ineligible for purchase order award. 

If an unfavorable final background investigation determination is made, the purchase order may be terminated and the employee in question shall not be authorized to provide service to the BIA, OIEP, if the services involve contact with or regular control over Indian children.

Award will be made to the lowest priced offeror, whose quotation is conforming to the requirements herein, will be most advantageous to the Government, and is fair and reasonable.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

(D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process; and</p>
<p>(4) The Government has marked the record "Active".</p>
<p>"System for Award Management (SAM)" means the primary Government repository for prospective Federal awardee and Federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance-related processes. It includes-</p>

<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>
<p>(A) Change the name in the SAM database;</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted-</p>
<p>(i) Via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the Contractor does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or</p>

<p>"Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number" means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&amp;B) to identify unique business entities.</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern.

<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, and Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code into the SAM database; and</p>

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br />0002 Monitor 20 EA</p>
<p>(End of provision)</p>

<p>(b) The Contractor shall comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items, including, but not limited to, the requirement for contractors to register with the Department of State in accordance with the ITAR. The Contractor shall consult with the Department of State regarding any questions relating to compliance with the ITAR and shall consult with the Department of Commerce regarding any questions relating to compliance with the EAR.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>
<p>(1) The Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2401, et seq.);</p>

<p>(a) 26 U.S.C. 6331(h) authorizes the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to continuously levy up to 100 percent of contract payments, up to the amount of tax debt.</p>
<p>(b) When a levy is imposed on a payment under this contract and the Contractor believes that the levy may result in an inability to perform the contract, the Contractor shall promptly notify the Procuring Contracting Officer in writing, with a copy to the Administrative Contracting Officer, and shall provide-</p>
<p>(1) The total dollar amount of the levy;</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<DESC>NASA/NSSC intends to issue a sole source contract to Laser Technology Associates, 28 Charles Street, Tolland, CT 06084 under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)(i). It has been determined that Laser Technology Associates is the sole provider of 6" Stainless 347 Nozzles, 27" Dia Freeform Nozzle and 6" Inconel 625 Nozzles. <br /><br />1.	Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) requires the freeform laser deposition closeout to complete the testing and meet all the inspections and joint requirements that are critical to safety margins. NASA has developed this novel closeout process along with industry partner, Laser Technology Associates (LTA). LTA uses proprietary fiber laser and wire fed processing techniques and control algorithms to enable the technology and provide robust joints. LTA is also the only vendor capable of this technology and has signed a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) with NASA to integrate the NASA portion of the technology. The NASA developed process does not exist at any of the centers and the only vendor capable of this process is LTA. <br /><br />2.	This part is critical to hot-fire testing planned at NASA-MSFC in support of nozzle development using channel wall technology. This component and processing allows wall temperatures to be adequately maintained so that there are no structural failures. Without this component and process, the hardware would not survive the environment. The use of this deposition closeout process is critical since it allows the joints to be fully inspected - eliminating critical failure modes and also provides a robust joint. Failure to procure this would result in failure to test and significant schedule delays. <br />

<p>(VI) Description of requirements is as follows:</p>
<p>STATEMENT OF NEED (SON)<br />DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE (DOC)<br />NATIONAL OCEANIC ATMOSPHERIC ADMINISTRATION (NOAA)<br />NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE (NWS)<br />SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA WFO (WEATHER FORECAST OFFICE)</p>
<p>PURCHASE REQUEST - NWWT9933-17-00008</p>
<p>HELIUM SUPPLY, DELIVERY AND CYLINDER RENTAL</p>
<p><br />1. BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The National Weather Service (NWS) is a 24 hour, 365 day operation, and is a public safety agency. The primary mission of the NWS is the protection of life and property. The NWS in Monterey, CA has a separate launch facility in Oakland, California that launches weather balloons routinely twice a day at 0400 and 1600 Pacific Time. Each balloon requires approximately 80 cubic feet (CF) of helium. Instrumentation is attached to each balloon which provides measurements of temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, and height. This data is transmitted worldwide and used to make weather forecasts out to 10 days.</p>
<p>2. OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The objective of the NWS is to receive and keep onsite an adequate supply of helium (no less than 480 CF, up to 3,840 CF) to perform the weather balloon launches on schedule.</p>
<p>3. SCOPE</p>
<p>The Contractor is responsible for supplying hydrogen to the NWS upper air facility located at 6100 Old Earhart Rd., Oakland, CA 94614. The total amount of helium to be delivered for the 12 month period of this requirement will be a minimum of 58,400 CF, up to a maximum of 64,160 CF. The helium will be supplied at regular intervals throughout the period, provided as individual cylinders, delivered approximately every two weeks. See Delivery Schedule in Section 6, below, for details.</p>
<p>4. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE</p>
<p>The period of performance for the requirement is February 01, 2017 through January 31, 2018.</p>
<p>5. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE</p>
<p>All deliveries are to be made to the NWS upper air facility at 6100 Old Earhart Rd. Oakland, CA 94614. The point of delivery is at the Upper Air Inflation building. The building is located inside a locked-fence compound area. A key for this area will be provided to the Contractor upon contract award. The key shall be returned to the NWS upon contract completion.</p>
<p>6. REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>Site Storage and Usage: All helium must be provided in individual cylinders as the facility is not arranged to allow for other configurations. The Government has space at the delivery point to receive and store up to 14 cylinders of helium at a time.</p>
<p>This site uses a minimum of 160 CF of helium per day, every day of the year. Actual use has the potential to vary if we have to launch extra balloons. We anticipate using 2,240 CF every 2 weeks, but need to keep an additional store of helium on site in case of additional unforeseen launches. The intent is that we will be replenished to our maximum of approximately 2,720 CF after each completed delivery.</p>
<p>Initial Delivery: The contractor shall supply a minimum of 2,720 CF of helium on February 01, 2017. The actual amount of supplied will vary based on the size of the cylinders. The helium will be contained in no more than 14 individual cylinders.</p>
<p>Delivery Schedule: Deliveries shall be made every other week. The delivery schedule shall be arranged with the NWS Observation Program Leader (OPL), Meteorologist-In-Charge (MIC), or Administrative Support Assistant (ASA) upon contract award (see section 9 below for contact information).</p>
<p>If additional deliveries are required prior to the next regularly scheduled delivery, the NWS will contact the Contractor and request the additional delivery, with delivery to be completed within three calendar days of being contacted.</p>
<p>Balloon launches occur twice a day, every day of the year, regardless of holidays. Therefore, the delivery schedule needs to be maintained regardless of holidays. If a holiday falls on a scheduled delivery day and the Contractor is not able to complete a regularly scheduled delivery, the Contractor shall make arrangements in advance for an alternate delivery date. The Contractor will contact the NWS office if a delivery is going to be delayed for any other reason. If the Contractor is unable to find a reasonable supply in time to fill the requirement, the NWS reserves the right to purchase helium from another supplier outside of this contract.<br /><br />Performing Deliveries: The point of delivery is not staffed except for during the balloon launches. The Contractor will be provided a key to the fenced area. The Contractor is responsible for ensuring the gates are properly secured upon departure. The key will be returned to the National Weather Service upon completion of the contract. All equipment necessary for loading and unloading the helium shall be provided by the Contractor.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall perform the pickup of empty cylinders and delivery of full cylinders in the same trip. The Contractor shall ensure the bottles are securely strapped to the stand at delivery and placed in an orderly/neat and clean fashion with cap loose and nozzle facing out. The Contractor shall perform the deliveries in such a manner that there will be minimal interruption to or interference with the normal operation of Government business on the premises.<br /><br />Transition Period: If this contract is awarded to other than the incumbent Contractor, then prior to the first day of the contract, the new Contractor and one of the agency points of contact (OPL, MIC, or ASA) shall establish the delivery schedule, including coordinating the initial delivery to coincide with the pickup of cylinders by the former contractor. Likewise, upon completion of this contract, if the new follow-on contract is awarded to other than the current Contractor, the current Contractor shall participate in the transition coordination efforts in order to minimize the risk of a missed balloon launch due to the helium being unavailable at the launch site. The end-of-contract transition period may include a lighter delivery in the final weeks of the contract.</p>
<p>Evidence of Delivery: The Driver shall leave a signed receipt with each delivery. A copy of the signed receipt shall also be attached to the associated invoice when mailed.</p>
<p>Compliance: If any of the deliveries do not conform to contract requirements (i.e. a delivery results in less than full replenishment of helium to 2,720 CF), the Government reserves the right to require the Contractor to bring the delivery into conformity with contract requirements, at no increase in contract amount (i.e. without additional delivery charges).</p>
<p>7. SECURITY BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION</p>
<p>Due to the Contractor being permitted unsupervised access to the site, a basic security background investigation must be completed for all personnel who will have access to the gate key. The Contractor is required to designate at least one, but no more than three, contractor personnel to perform the helium deliveries. Prior to the key being issued, the designated personnel must pass a fingerprint check performed by the Department of Commerce Western Region Security Office (WRSO).</p>
<p>The Contractor is responsible for providing, at its own expense, all information necessary to complete the security investigation, including official fingerprint charts. The fingerprint charts shall be provided to the ASA for submission to the WRSO. The NWS will bear the expense of conducting the actual background investigation(s).</p>
<p>The Contractor shall not assign any personnel that do not receive a favorable result of the security investigation to perform deliveries to this site.</p>
<p>8. SAFETY</p>
<p>All rules concerning safety, not smoking and the security of the property must be observed at all times.</p>
<p>Materials Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) must be provided by the Contractor to the MIC or ASA at each office, where the information will be kept on file in accordance with applicable guidelines of the OSHA Hazard Communications Standard. Requirements pertaining to recordkeeping will be strictly followed, with copy(s) provided to MIC as necessary and upon request.</p>
<p>9. POINTS OF CONTACT</p>
<p>The Government contacts at the NWS office in Monterey, CA are:</p>
<p>Observation Program Leader - (831) 656-1710<br />Administrative Support Assistant - (831) 656-1710 x221<br />Meteorologist In Charge - (831) 656-1710 x222</p>
<p>10. INVOICING</p>
<p>The Contractor will invoice on a monthly basis in arrears for that month's helium deliveries and related surcharges (i.e. cylinder rental fee, etc.). The invoice must include the following items:</p>
<p>a. Name and address of the contractor, which must be the same as that on the Purchase Order<br />b. Invoice date and invoice number<br />c. Purchase Order number and associated line item number from the Purchase Order<br />d. Description, quantity, unit of measure, unit price and extended price of supplies delivered, and date of delivery<br />e. Evidence of delivery by way of receipt signed by NWS representative at the time of delivery<br />f.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>NOAA ACQUISITION AND GRANTS OFFICE OMBUDSMAN (OCT 2016)</p>
<p>a. The NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO) Ombudsman is available to organizations to promote responsible and meaningful exchanges of information. Generally, the purpose of these exchanges will be to:</p>
<p>1. Allow contractors to better prepare for and propose on business opportunities.</p>
<p>2. Advise as to technologies and solutions within the marketplace that the Government may not be aware of, or is not fully benefiting from.</p>
<p>3. Identify constraints in transparency and process.</p>
<p>b. The AGO Ombudsman will objectively, reasonably, and responsibly collaborate with parties and recommend fair, impartial, and constructive solutions to the matters presented to him/her. Further, the AGO Ombudsman will maintain the reasonable and responsible confidentiality of the source of a concern, when such a request has been formally made by an authorized officer of an organization seeking to do business with, or already doing business with NOAA.</p>
<p>c. Before consulting with the AGO Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations with the respective contracting officer for resolution. However, direct access to the AGO Ombudsman may be sought when an interested party questions the objectivity or equity of a contracting officer's decision, or when there is a bona fide reason to believe that reasonable, responsible, and objective consideration will not be received from an assigned contracting officer.</p>
<p>d. There are several constraints to the scope of the AGO Ombudsman's authority, for instance:</p>
<p>1. Consulting with the AGO Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines of any formal process (e.g., protests, claims, debriefings, employee employer actions, activities involving A-76 competition performance decisions, judicial or congressional hearings, or proposal, amendment, modification or deliverable due dates, etc.).</p>
<p>2. The AGO Ombudsman cannot participate in the evaluation of proposals, source selection processes, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.</p>
<p>3. The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to generate or alter laws, judicial decisions, rules, policies, or formal guidance.</p>
<p>4. The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to develop or alter opportunity announcements, solicitations, contracts, or their terms or conditions.</p>
<p>5. The AGO Ombudsman cannot overrule the authorized decisions or determinations of the contracting officer.</p>
<p>6. The AGO Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds AGO, NOAA, the Department of Commerce, or the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>7. The AGO Ombudsman is not NOAA's agent relative to the service of magistrate or judicial process and cannot be used to extend service of process to another party (whether federal, public, or a private entity).</p>
<p>e. After review and analysis of a filed concern or recommendation, the AGO Ombudsman may refer the interested party to another more suitable federal official for consideration. Moreover, concerns, disagreements, and/or recommendations that cannot be resolved by the AGO Ombudsman will need to be pursued through more formal venues.</p>
<p>f. The AGO Ombudsman is not to be contacted to request copies of forms and/or documents under the purview of a contracting officer. Such documents include Requests for Information, solicitations, amendments, contracts, modifications, or conference materials.</p>
<p>g. Questions regarding this solicitation and contract language shall be directed to Rafael Roman, NOAA AGO Ombudsman, at Rafael.Roman@noaa.gov.</p>
<p>(End of solicitation and contract language)</p>
<p>NOAA Acquisition Manual (NAM) Clauses</p>
<p>(a) A contractor employee shall be identified both by the individual's name and the contractor's name when:<br />1. Included in NOAA's locator, and<br />2. When submitting any type of electronic correspondence to any NOAA employee or stakeholder.</p>
<p>(b) Any written correspondence from a contractor or any contractor employee shall be printed on company/organization letterhead or otherwise clearly identify the sender as an employee of the company or organization and shall identify the contract number.</p>
<p>(c) Contractors and/or contractor employees shall clearly identify themselves as such in any verbal communications, whether in informal discussion or a formal meeting.</p>

<DESC>(i) This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.
<p>(ii) The requisition number is OIG188776. The solicitation is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).</p>

<p>(vi) Description of requirements - This is brand name requirement for NCPDP dataQ subscription only. The NCPDP Provider Identification (ID) number is a proprietary number that is not available from any other data provider. Prior to implementation and assignment of the National Provider Identifier (NPI) by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the NCPDP Provider ID was the industry-wide number for identifying pharmacies in claims transactions. Even today, NCPDP ID and the CMS-assigned NPI are linked and frequently both numbers are used in the transaction process. Because OIG analysts need a way to identify pharmacies that existed before the implementation of the NPI, the NCPDP is the only provider of the legacy Provider ID number. NCPDP's dataQ<sup>TM</sup> is an advanced pharmacy database that provides detailed pharmacy information, including information specific to state license IDs, change of ownership, pharmacy services, and remittance and reconciliation information. This database enables the Office of inspector General (OIG) to conduct extensive data analyses to continue oversight of the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The NCPDP is a comprehensive database that enables OIG to continue to conduct extensive data analyses and enhance OIG data analytical tools for continued oversight of the Medicate and Medicaid programs.</p>

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract
awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was
established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and timeconsuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a
prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an
Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some
external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file
a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.

Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG
procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable
Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested
parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under
this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of
an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or
other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following
information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting
Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest,
protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer
through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an Independent
Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either
the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.
Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award
or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in
writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in
less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth
in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the
protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed
within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program
should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand
delivery to the Contracting Officer.

Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the
Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not
to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external
forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.

The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract<br />awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was<br />established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and timeconsuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a<br />prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an<br />Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some<br />external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file<br />a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG<br />procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable<br />Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested<br />parties are encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under<br />this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of<br />an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or<br />other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following<br />information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting<br />Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest,<br />protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer<br />through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent<br />Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either<br />the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.<br />Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award<br />or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in<br />writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in<br />less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth<br />in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the<br />protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed<br />within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program<br />should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand<br />delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a USCG procurement to the<br />Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not<br />to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external<br />forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.</p>

Phase I awards are typically $70,000 to $150,000 in size, and the period of performance is generally from six to twelve months. Proposals should concentrate on research or research and development which will significantly contribute to proving the scientific and technical feasibility, and commercialization potential of the proposed effort, the successful completion of which is a prerequisite for further DoD support in Phase II. Proposers are encouraged to consider whether the research or research and development being proposed to DoD Components also has private sector potential, either for the proposed application or as a base for other applications.<br /><br />Phase II awards will be made to firms on the basis of results of their Phase I effort and the scientific merit, technical merit, and commercialization potential of the Phase II proposal. Phase II awards are typically $500,000 to $1,000,000 in size and the period of performance is generally 24 months. Phase II is the principal research or research and development effort and is expected to produce a well-defined deliverable prototype. A Phase II contractor may receive up to one additional, sequential Phase II award for continued work on the project.<br /><br />Under Phase III, the Proposer is required to obtain funding from either the private sector, a non-SBIR Government source, or both, to develop the prototype into a viable product or non-R&amp;D service for sale in military or private sector markets. SBIR Phase III refers to work that derives from, extends, or completes an effort made under prior SBIR funding agreements, but is funded by sources other than the SBIR Program. Phase III work is typically oriented towards commercialization of SBIR research or technology.<strong><br /><br />SBIR Preface Instructions and Solicitation Website</strong><br />WEBLINK for this DoD SBIR Solicitation is: https://sbir.defensebusiness.org Offerors assume the risk of website inaccessibility due to heavy usage in the final hours before the solicitation closing time, therefore, plan ahead and submit early.

<p>Sole Source Synopsis - Notice of Intent to Award</p>
<p>FA8629-17-D-5001 (RFI # FA8629-15-D-2475)</p>
<p>Battlefield Airmen Video Data Link<br />Production and Sustainment Contract</p>
<p>NAICS Code: 334220; Small Business Size Standard is 1,250 employees.</p>
<p>The Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC), Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance/Special Operations Forces (ISR/SOF) Directorate, SOF Division, Battlefield Airmen Branch, Wright- Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio intends to issue a Contract to provide production and sustainment capabilities for non-developmental Video Data Link (VDL) systems. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source IAW 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source. Market Research determined that the continued production and sustainment of the highly specialized Video Data Link (VDL) systems is only available from one contractor without unacceptable delays or duplication of cost. The Government intends to award an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract by January 2017 to L-3 Communications Corporation, Communication Systems West, 640 N 2200 W, Salt Lake City, UT 84116-2925, CAGE 06401. L-3 CSW is a large business. This is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation is available.</p>

The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes, nor does the Ombudsman diminish the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. When approached with an issue or query the Ombudsman independently assesses the situation and provides a response or initiates a resolution, and when requested, will maintain confidentiality as to the source of the inquiry.</p>
<p>Contact information for the AFLCMC Ombudsman is as follows:</p>

<DESC>Amendment No.: 0002 for Solicitation No.: A17PS00088 is as follows:

1. To extend the response time to Wednesday, December 7, 2016 at 12:00 p.m. Mountain time.

2. To respond to questions received. No more questions will be accepted.

It lists under 1. Summary of Tech capabilities - "qualifications and related asbestos, lead based paint experience..."  This seems to be a carry over from another solicitation and not directly applicable to the scope of work (e.g. decommissioning of groundwater monitoring wells).
Response.  Please ignore.  It is my standard statement for performance.  

If we overdrill and grout the existing wells who will be responsible for disposal of the drill cuttings?  If the contractor, should we include disposal costs in the well decommissioning cost or list under other?  
Response:  The contractor is responsible for disposal of all drill cuttings.  You may include it under decommissioning costs.  Please note the wells are shallow wells no deeper than 17-20 feet.  

Though the site has been remediated, residual contamination may exist at the site and be brought up with the drill cuttings.  This will require a laboratory analysis step to clear the waste for disposal.  Is there a location where drums can be stored awaiting analytical results for disposal?
Response:  The cost of analyses should be included in the cost of decommissioning the wells.    It is recommended the contractor identify expedited analyses of  any samples to minimize delays.  The drums can be stored on site in the little guard shack at the entrance.  The contractor should dispose of the drums as soon as possible following receipt of the analytical data.

Also with regard to waste disposal - what entity should be listed as the generator?
Response:  The BIA should be listed as the generator.  Mr. Benjamin Keith, Shiprock Agency Safety Officer will be the individual authorized to sign on behalf of BIA. He should be contacted to sign the manifests 24 hours before shipment of waste/disposal is conducted.   BIA can provide a RCRA ID number if required in the event soils cannot be recycled and must be disposed.

Is there a remediation final report which can be reviewed/included as part of the solicitation documents?  Something that provides exact locations and depths of each well, remediation goals achieved, etc..."
Response:  Attached is the 2011 and 2012 GWM Report with 2012 being final. USEPA and NNEPA issued a NFA following receipt of the 2012 report.

<p>The Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC), Battlefield Airmen Branch (BA) is soliciting information to identify sources to provide Engineering Manufacturing and Development (EMD), production, and sustainment capabilities for Dismounted VDL systems. The Dismounted VDL program was approved to enhance dismounted system capability and to address loss of spectrum, due to spectrum auction. Bandwidths 1695-1710 and 1755-1780MHz were auctioned in L-Band, and bandwidths 2025-2110MHz were expanded in the lower portion of S-Band.</p>
<p>VDL capability improves Intelligence, Surveillance, &amp; Reconnaissance (ISR) essential to close air support, Command &amp; Control (C2), air superiority, target identification, and situational awareness (SA). The Dismounted VDL system's overall concept is to receive, transmit, and display secure and unsecure FMV and annotated images to and from C2 nodes (Dismounted, Mounted, Airborne) via a small, lightweight, ruggedized, and reliable receiver or transceiver. The system will be operator-carried for long durations on limited battery power in a full spectrum of environmental and combat conditions.</p>
<p>Minimum Dismounted VDL Requirements</p>
<p>This system is required to possess Type 1 encryption capability through the use of NSA cryptocore modernization (CCM) and Government approved AES encryption. The Government desires this system to be depot-level repairable. The system must be interoperable with 466ER, Tactical, VNW, FM analog, DDL, STD-CDL and BE-CDL waveforms. The system must support UHF, L-Band, S-Band, C-Band, and KU-Band and support new S-Band frequencies of 2025 to 2110 MHz. The system must be water-resistant and ruggedized. The government anticipates allocating 10 to 15 million dollars to this effort or efforts.</p>
<p>The government is interested in evolutionary increases in capability, as well as reductions in Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP). This may culminate in multiple development efforts and contracts; both for an advanced capability device, as well as for a very low SWaP, receive-only device.</p>
<p>1. In addition to meeting the above requirements, provide a technology development roadmap for Dismounted VDL, for receive-only and transceiver systems, for the next 5 years. <br />2. The system requirements for the transceiver may require networking capability in either a mesh or hub-spoke structure.<br />3. Identify other peripherals envisioned to be necessary to utilize your system?<br />4. Identify GPS capability you can provide within the stated timeline?<br />5. Describe the user interface of any proposed system, including the Web-based graphical user interface, if applicable.<br />6. What improvements in SWaP can you achieve in this timeline, and how?</p>
<p>Sustainment</p>
<p>1. Describe your training concept.<br />2. What is the maintenance concept to include software updates?<br />3. What built-in test/diagnostic capabilities do you envision? <br />4. Describe your approach for repair and diagnostic capabilities of the system.</p>
<p>System Quality</p>
<p>1. What mean time between failure (MTBF) and Mean Time to Repair (MTTR) have you achieved in previous similar products?</p>
<p>Capabilities Package<br />The capabilities package should be brief and concise, yet clearly demonstrate an ability to meet the stated requirements. The package shall include the following information and address the questions below:</p>
<p>Company/Institute Name: <br />Address: <br />Point of Contact (to include phone number and email address) : <br />CAGE Code: <br />Web Page URL: <br />Size of business pursuant to NAICS Code Insert 6 digit code and title here, size standard Insert size standard here. Based on the above NAICS Code, state whether your company is:</p>
<p>Small Business (Yes / No) Self-Certified or Third Party Certified<br />Women-Owned Small Business (Yes / No) Self-Certified or Third Party Certified<br />Economically Disadvantaged Women-<br />Owned Small Business (Yes/No) Self-Certified or Third Party Certified<br />HUBZone Certified (Yes / No) Self-Certified or Third Party Certified<br />Veteran Owned Small Business (Yes / No) Self-Certified or Third Party Certified<br />Service Disabled Veteran Owned<br />Small Business (Yes / No) Self-Certified or Third Party Certified<br />8(a) Certified (Yes / No) Self-Certified or Third Party Certified<br />SBA Certification Date: ____________ SBA Graduation Date: ______________</p>
<p>The NAICS code for this requirement, if applicable to the company's capabilities, should be included in the company's NAICS code listing in SAM.</p>
<p>Is your company domestically or foreign owned (if foreign, please indicate the country of ownership).</p>
<p>Respondents should also state whether they are interested in being a prime contractor for this requirement or a subcontractor.</p>
<p><br />Responses, communications and additional considerations:</p>
<p>One (1) paper copies should be submitted to the program office as outlined below. Respondents shall limit submissions to 20 pages or less and should include technical and descriptive text to provide sufficient detail on production and sustainment capabilities. The submitted documentation becomes the property of the U.S. Government and will not be returned. <br />Respondents who submit proprietary data shall clearly mark the data with appropriate markings on the cover sheet and on each applicable page. Any proprietary data submitted may be handled by contract support services personnel who have signed Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDA). Any material that is not marked proprietary will be considered publicly-releasable. Any proprietary information received in response to this request will be properly protected from any unauthorized disclosure. The Government will not use proprietary information submitted from any one firm to establish the capability and requirements for any future systems acquisition, so as to not inadvertently restrict competition.</p>
<p>The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI. A determination not to compete this action based on responses received is solely within the discretion of the Government. E-mail copies of the paper submittal will be accepted. Responses shall be received by 4:00pm (est), on 12 October 2015. Paper/e-mail submittals should be sent to the below contacts within AFLCMC/WISK. Broad industry participation for this Sources Sought is encouraged. U.S. and non-U.S. firms are permitted to respond to this Dismounted VDL System Sources Sought.

<DESC><p>The Air Force mission is dependent upon sensor superiority for radar, electronic warfare and communications. The need for superiority extends from DC to microwave through sub-mm wave (300MHz - 300GHz). Exploitation of homo/hetero-epitaxial devices fabricated on SiC holds promise for revolutionary improvements in the cost, size, weight and performance of a broad range of military RF and power management and distribution components. Gallium Nitride (GaN) High Electron Mobility Transistors (HEMTs) are rapidly becoming the technology of choice for high power RF amplification. The combination of high voltage and current handling as well as switching frequency capabilities make SiC based power devices a viable alternative to silicon technology. Fabrication of SiC power devices requires homo-epitaxial growth of precisely doped SiC layers ranging in thickness from a few microns to &gt; 100 &mu;m. Critical to the realization of this promise is the availability of large diameter semi-conducting and semi-insulating SiC substrates.</p>
<p>The goal of this effort is to develop a merchant oriented manufacturer of affordable, high quality, 200mm conducting (4H N-doped) and semi-insulating (6H V-doped) SiC substrates and SiC epitaxial films for use in advanced GaN and SiC radio frequency (RF) and power switching semiconductor devices.</p>
<p>This effort encompasses the development, assessment and manufacturing of single crystal SiC boules, homoepitaxial films and associated device demonstrations. Technical goals include; 1). SiC Crystal Growth, 2) SiC Substrate Fabrication and Polishing, 3) SiC Homoepitaxy, 4) Material Characterization, 5) Material and Device Correlation.</p>

<p>This notice is a synopsis in accordance with FAR 5.203(a)(1) for a proposed contract action to Contract W52P1J-11-D-0059. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals or quotations and a solicitation will not be issued for this requirement.</p>
<p>The Army Contract Command - Rock Island intends to award a modification to include in and around Iraq operations and revise the scope of the HL7 operations to include the requirement to provide line haul security for in and around Iraq operations under the existing Heavy Lift 7 Contract W52P1J-11-D-0059 for the period of 01 January 2017 through 31 August 2017 under the authority 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1), Only One Responsible Source, as implemented by FAR 6.302-1. The contract period of period of performance was initially for a base year plus four option periods. FAR clause 52.217-8 was exercised for a period of 01 September 2016 through 28 February 2017. An additional six-month option may be exercised, pursuant to FAR 6.302 and FAR 52.217-9, for a period of performance of 01 March 2017 through 31 August 2017. The J&amp;A for these extension periods was previously posted to FBO.gov.</p>
<p>The initial solicitation W52P1J-10-R-0132 was originally synopsized, as well as the original issuance of the contract W52P1J-11-D-0059. The option to extend services under FAR clause 52.217-8 and the above mentioned addition six-month option was synopsized on 10 May 2016.</p>
<p>The above discussed Iraq modification is intended to be awarded to El Hoss Engineering &amp; Transport Co WLL under 6.302-1 when it is likely that award to any other source would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements. A follow-on competition is underway for the follow-on Heavy Lift contract and a draft PWS has been posted to FedBizOps.</p>
<p>This modification will expand critical line haul support services throughout the and Central Command AOR. Services to be provided include all personnel, equipment, tools, materials, supervision, and non-personal services necessary to securely perform commercial line haul, heavy lift and personnel transportation services.</p>
<p>All responsible source may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.

A follow-on competition is underway for the follow-on Heavy Lift contract and a draft PWS has been posted to FedBizOps.</p>
<p>This modification will expand critical line haul support services throughout the and Central Command AOR. Services to be provided include all personnel, equipment, tools, materials, supervision, and non-personal services necessary to securely perform commercial line haul, heavy lift and personnel transportation services.</p>
<p>All responsible source may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency. A determination not to compete this requirement, based on responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. The Government will not be responsible for any costs incurred by interested parties in responding to this synopsis. The Government is not obligated to and will not pay for any information received from potential sources as a result of this notice</p>

2.  Description of the Required Services
Navigation Technical Assistance Contract
The Federal Aviation Administration is in the process of modernizing the National Airspace System (NAS) to meet the needs of the 21st Century.  Inherent in this mission is the requirement to provide a safe, cost-effective, navigation and timing service. Currently, navigation requirements are largely met with legacy, ground-based navigation, and lighting systems.  FAA has committed to evolving the NAS to Performance Based Navigation (AIR SPACE SERVICES GROUP).  During this lengthy transition, FAA has a requirement to support both legacy and modernized navigation systems.  

Through the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen), FAA is addressing the impact of air traffic growth by increasing capacity and efficiency while improving safety, reducing environmental impacts, and increasing user access to the National Airspace System (NAS).  AIR SPACE SERVICES GROUP is an essential element of the NextGen plan to modernize the NAS.  To achieve NextGen goals, FAA is implementing new AIR SPACE SERVICES GROUP routes and procedures that leverage emerging space-based technologies and enhanced aircraft navigation capabilities.  

The NAVTAC II support Contractor will assist the Navigation Programs Group and Performance Based Navigation Offices in their joint mission to provide safe, cost-effective position, navigation, and timing services to meet the operational needs of current and future aviation customers that operate in the NAS.   The FAA Navigation Programs Group and the AIR SPACE SERVICES GROUP Office have a need for professional services covering areas such as engineering support, logistics, software integration and maintenance, training, operations research and analysis, requirements development and analysis, and business and material management. Examples include technical support services to assist in the planning, research, development, engineering, implementation, sustainment, and decommissioning of various navigation, landing, and lighting systems, as well as support for the AIR SPACE SERVICES GROUP Instrument Flight Procedure (IFP) process. 

3.  The FAA intends to use FAA and contractor support staff in reviewing and evaluating any responses to this announcement and will ensure that the appropriate organizational conflict of interest and nondisclosure agreements are signed prior to any review.

<DESC><strong>Special Notice</strong>
<p><strong>Department of Homeland Security (DHS)<br />Office of the Chief Readiness Support Officer (OCRSO)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Electric Vehicle (EV) Demonstration for Law Enforcement and Security Agencies</strong><br />________________________________________</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong></p>
<p>This announcement does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or solicitation of vendor products or services. Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response. This announcement is not an indication that a contractual commitment will exist in any way associated with the demonstration, and is not in any way tied to any procurement activities. The government will not award a contract on the basis of this demonstration. No funds are available to fund vendor participation in the demonstration, including transport to and from the event location. No marketing or promotional materials will be allowed or accepted. No video recording or photography will be allowed. Any information received will become the property of the government and will not be returned to the submitter. DHS also reserves the right to cancel this demonstration at any time due to weather, level of participation, or other reasons identified by the government.</p>
<p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong></p>
<p>DHS is issuing this request for information to understand the potential advantages of EVs for federal law enforcement and security agencies, and to support Executive Order 13693 (E.O. 13693), Planning for Federal Sustainability in the Next Decade, which allows for the exemption of law-enforcement, emergency response, and defense mission (e.g. tactical) vehicles, but states that agencies should consider:</p>
<p>&bull;The ability of alternative fuel vehicles to meet the range of needs of law enforcement personnel including apprehensions, arrests, pursuit, surveillance, protection or off-road duties;</p>
&bull;Criteria for the administrative use of vehicles by agency personnel for travel to and from normal place of work; and
<p>&bull;Advancements in vehicle and fleet technology that may render conventional practice regarding necessary vehicle size and fuel type outdated in the future.</p>
<p>As part of its market research, DHS will hold a demonstration of these EVs on December 12, 2016, at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) in Cheltenham, Maryland. This demonstration will provide an opportunity for industry vendors to demonstrate their EV capabilities at FLETC's driving facilities with FLETC driving instructors to provide a realistic set of driving scenarios. State law enforcement and security agencies are also invited to attend the demonstration. For the purposes of this demonstration, an "electric vehicle" is defined as a commercially-available vehicle that is either a 100% Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV), Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV), or a Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV), and that has met all federal safety requirements in its vehicle class.</p>
<p><strong>SCOPE</strong></p>
<p>FLETC driving instructors will demonstrate vendors' vehicles in one or more of the following ways:</p>
<p>a. High-speed maneuvering and braking for passenger vehicles performed by FLETC driving instructors on a dedicated section of track.</p>
<p><br />b. Low-speed obstacle course for passenger vehicles performed by FLETC driving instructors on a dedicated section of track.</p>
<p>c. Low-speed obstacle course and medium-speed maneuvering course for electric motorcycles on a dedicated section of track.</p>
<p>d. Low-speed off-road course for off-road-capable vehicles on a dedicated off-road track performed by FLETC driving instructors.</p>
<p>The following conditions must be met by each vendor, without exception, to participate:</p>
<p>All vendors must sign the Vendor Demonstration Agreement (Attachment 1) as a condition of participation. DHS and its FLETC drivers will not sign any waiver form from vendors, nor will passengers attending from agencies and participating in the demonstrations. Only FLETC driving instructors will drive the vehicles during the track demonstration. Electric motorcycles and off-road EVs must be driven by the vendor and/or agency representatives on a separate demonstration course.</p>
<p>Potential vendors must complete advance registration (see below) by <strong>December 7, 2016</strong> and are limited to three attendees per vendor unless prior authorization is granted by DHS. Due to time and space limitations, this is a "first come, first served" registration. If the capacity of FLETC to demonstrate multiple vendors' EVs is reached, registration will be closed even if the closure occurs prior to the registration deadline.</p>
<p>All vendors must provide their "electric vehicle" on the date of the demonstration. An "electric vehicle" as defined as a commercially-available vehicle that is either a 100% Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV), Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV), or a Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV), and that has met all federal safety requirements in its vehicle class.</p>
<p><strong>RESPONSES</strong></p>
<p>All U.S. citizen attendees, born or naturalized, must complete the SEM-17Z form (Attachment 2). This form must be submitted no later than <strong>December 7, 2016</strong> to e-mails: Lance.Kennedy@fletc.dhs.gov and Phillip.A.Frederick@fletc.dhs.gov.</p>
<p>In accordance with FLETC Directive and Manual 71-01, Physical Access Control, all foreign nationals (FN) must submit a completed form SEM-17b-1 (Attachment 3) and SEM-17b-2 (Attachment 4), at least 30 business days prior to the scheduled demonstration. Note: the SEM-17Z form (Attachment 2) is for U.S. citizens only.</p>
<p>The visit requirement documents needed for FN Visitors requesting access to FLETC:</p>
<p>1. Form FTC-SEM-17b-1 (Attachment 3), Foreign National Request for Access: Visit/Event Information (To Be Completed by Sponsor).</p>
<p>2. Form FTC-SEM-17b-2 (Attachment 4), Foreign National Request for Access: Information on Individual Foreign National (To Be Completed by Foreign National Applicant).</p>
<p>3. Copy of Passport.</p>
<p>4. Copy of U.S. Visa, if applicable.</p>
<p>5. Copy of Permanent Resident Card, if Lawful Permanent Resident.</p>
<p>6. FN Vetting Exception Request, if submittal is later than applicable deadline.</p>
<p>Vetting Package must be submitted to the Office of Security and Emergency Management's INS Chief. Requests for FNs must be submitted 30 days or more in advance. E-mailed vetting packages are accepted and preferred. Email: FLETC-InternalSecurity@fletc.dhs.gov</p>
<p>Requests for FN Access submitted in fewer than the required 30-day deadline must include a written FN Vetting Exception Request from an authorized senior official. The submittal of an FN Vetting Exception Request does not automatically guarantee access will be authorized; last minute real or potential security concerns/issues may result in the FN Vetting Exception Request and access being denied.</p>
<p>Each vendor must register for this demonstration via e-mail for their commitment to bring an electric vehicle made by their company along with the signed Vendor Demonstration Agreement form to e-mail addresses Lance.Kennedy@fletc.dhs.gov and Phillip.A.Frederick@fletc.dhs.gov no later than <strong>December 7, 2016</strong>.</p>

Attachment 4:  Single Source Justification for SAP under $150K

OFOC SOP Revision 03   Page 1 of 1
Revision 03 Date: 10/27/2014
JUSTIFICATION FOR SINGLE SOURCE AWARDS IAW FAR 13.106-1
(OVER MICRO-PURCHASE THRESHOLD($3K) BUT NOT EXCEEDING THE SAT ($150K))
IAW FAR13.104, COs must promote competition to the maximum extent practicable to obtain supplies and services from the source whose offer is the most advantageous to the Government, considering the administrative cost of the purchase. When competition is not practicable, IAW FAR13.106-1(b), COs solicit from a single source for purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold.  COs may solicit from one source if the CO determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, brand-name or industrial mobilization). IAW FAR13.106-3(b)(3),COs are required to include additional statements explaining the absence of competition (see 13.106-1 for brand name purchases) if only one source is solicited and the acquisition does not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold (does not apply to an acquisition of utility services available from only one source) or supporting the award decision if other than price-related factors were considered in selecting the supplier.  This template when completed can be used to document single source awards IAW FAR13.106-3(b)(3).  Note: Statements such as "only known source" or "only source which can meet the required delivery date" are inadequate to support a sole source purchase.  
1. PURCHASE REQUEST OR REQUISITION NUMBER:
568-17-1-5006-0007
1A. PROJECT/TASK NUMBER

1B. ESTIMATED AMOUNT: 
$12,360.45
2. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED AND THE INTENDED USE:

Service contract for the Biomerieux lab equipment located in the Ft. Meade VAMC lab. 


3. UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS THAT LIMIT AVAILABILITY TO ONLY ONE SOURCE, WITH THE REASON NO OTHER SUPPLIES OR SERVICES CAN BE USED:
This contract is Proprietary to the manufacturer, Biomerieux.   
This equipment can only be serviced and maintained by the OEM. It contains proprietary software which eliminates a third party vendor from doing the required annual maintenance and repairs.  This information was verified by the Contractor and Service Line.   


4.  REASON THAT SUGGESTED SOURCE IS THE ONLY SOURCE, WHICH CAN PROVIDE THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES:  
Biomerieux is the OEM and is the only source available and authorized to provide service coverage.
This information was confirmed by the CO with the Contractor and Service Line.


5. DESCRIPTION OF MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AND RESULTS OR STATEMENT WHY IT WAS NOT CONDUCTED: contact with vendor. No other sources found that are authorized to service equipment. 
If other qualified and authorized OEM-trained companies become available to repair this equipment in the future, new sources will be sought.

6. Contracting Officer's Certification: Purchase is approved in accordance with FAR13.106-1(b). I certify that the foregoing justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

Justification and Approval
For
Exception to Fair Opportunity Memo

Acquisition Plan Action ID:VA69D-16-AP-7172

Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs, NCO 12, Great Lakes Acquisition Center (GLAC). Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition for 695-17-1-6127-0002.

Description of Action: This proposed service contract is for a one-time firm-fixed price installation of security equipment on the existing security system with Johnson Controls, 1200 W. Wirth Street, Suite 102 Wauwatosa, WI 53222.   
Description of Supplies or Services:  The proposed action is to provide installation of required CCTC camera systems, including required monitoring devices, monitors and all required cabling and licensing necessary for the functionality of the systems located at the Domiciliary 123. The new additions/upgrades must be compatible to communicate with the P-2000 server hub. The estimated cost is $427,662.00 to be installed by November 15, 2016.  
Statutory Authority:  The statutory authority permitting an exception to fair opportunity is Section 41 U.S.C. 4106(c) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 16.505 Subpart 16.505(b)(2)(i):   
 ( X ) FAR Subpart 16.505(b)(2)(i)(B): Only one awardee is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services ordered are unique or highly specialized.
Rationale Supporting Use of Authority Cited Above:  Upgrades to the current system include additional closed circuit television coverage, Physical Access Control Systems (PACS) and door contacts. The additions must have access to all upgrades, emergency replacements, programming, hardware and software maintenance. The system must also be compatible with the P-2000 server. The posted intent to sole source could not identify any other potential vendors that have the capability of communication with the server hub.  
6.  Efforts to Obtain Competition:   Intent to sole source was posted to FBO on October 14   October 25, 2016 and did not yield any additional sources that can meet the Government s requirements. There is no competition anticipated for this requirement. In accordance with FAR 


5.301 and 16.505(b)(2), this action will be synopsized at award on the Federal Business Opportunities Page (FBO) and the justification will be made publicly available.  
7.  Actions to Increase Competition:  The Government will continue to conduct market research to ascertain if there are changes in the market place that would enable future actions to be competed.
8.  Market Research: The Government posted the intent to sole source to FBO to search for additional sources that could meet the Government s minimum and compatibility requirements. No vendors were identified that could work with the security system. The Contracting Officer reached out to the vendor (Johnson Controls) that is currently providing service on the base contract however, Johnson Controls does not authorize any other vendors to communicate with the P2000 server which is the hub of communication for the security system. Furthermore, licensure and upgrades are proprietary to Johnson Controls and are not available through another vendor. 
9.  Other Facts: The security upgrades are not capable of modification to enhance competition. The current system services the Milwaukee Medical Center, Green Bay, Appleton, Cleveland and Union Grove clinics, Community Resource Referral Center and Honey Creek buildings. Due to the size of the security system other vendors are not able to add to the current system while maintaining its integrity to communicate with the server hub. A new system would have to be installed to produce additional competition however, to do that costs would far exceed expenditures needed to upgrade and operate the current system. 











 
10.  Technical and Requirements Certification:  I certify that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in this justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

11.  Determination that Anticipated Cost is Fair and Reasonable:  Based on historical prices paid for similar items and on catalog pricing, the Contracting Officer has determined that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable.  



12.  Contracting Officer's Certification (required): I certify that the foregoing justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

LIMITED SOURCE JUSTIFICATION
Medical Surgical Prime Vendor   Next Generation (MSPV-NG)
Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPA) for Medical Equipment and Supplies

CLASS LIMITED SOURCES JUSTIFICATION 

1.  Contracting Activity: Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)
    Office of Acquisition Operations
    Strategic Acquisition Center
    10300 Spotsylvania Avenue, Suite 400
    Fredericksburg, VA  22408

2.  Description of Action:  The proposed action is for medical equipment and supplies, under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 8.405-6,  Limited Sources.  The required items are supplied by FEDCO, LLC, a Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), located at 1792 Bell Tower Lane, Weston, FL 33336-3682.  These items will be procured via the VA Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) V797P-4084B to populate the MSPV-NG formulary with mandatory health care supplies.  The MSPV-NG formulary is a list of approved healthcare commodities including medical, surgical, dental, laboratory, facilities/cleaning products, and textiles.  This LSJ will supply the MSPV-NG formulary with medical equipment and supplies distributed by FEDCO, LLC. on a not-to-exceed 12-month period of performance until these items can be competed in accordance with FAR 8.405-3.  As the identified required items are competed, they will no longer be acquired under the LSJ; thus, bringing the MSPV-NG formulary in compliance with the FAR 8.405-3,  Blanket Purchase Agreements .

3.  Acquisition History:  VHA manages the largest integrated healthcare system in the United States.  In 2013, the system consisted of 21 Veterans Integrated Services Networks with approximately 150 medical centers, 820 outpatient clinics, and various other facilities to include Community Living Centers, Veteran Centers and Domiciliaries.  Together, these health care facilities, and the more than 53,000 independent licensed health care practitioners who work within them, provide comprehensive care to about 9.3 million enrolled Veterans.  The MSPV Program is the primary means to obtain medical and surgical supply support for the VA healthcare system through contract support.  VHA, in cooperation with VA s National Acquisition Center (NAC), initiated contract support for the MSPV program in 2005.  The result was the first generation of seven prime vendor distributor contracts that not only support VHA, but also support the Department of Health and Human Services, Department of State, Indian Health Service, and the Federal Bureau of Prisons.

Since that time, VHA and NAC have successfully executed two long-term, multiple-award 5-year contracts in support of the MSPV program.  In 2015, upon expiration of the second MSPV program, a set of bridge contracts were executed by the NAC extending the period of performance to April 19, 2016.  Those bridge contracts were as follows:  VA797N-15-C-0003, VA797N-15-C-0004, VA797N-15-C-0005, VA797N-15-C-0006, VA797N-15-C-0007, VA797N-15-C-0008, and VA797N-15-C-0009.  

In preparation for the continuation of the MSPV Program, the Strategic Acquisition Center (SAC) assumed responsibility to award the new MSPV-NG contracts in 2014.  Due to a protest and continued technical evaluations, the SAC Contracting Officer determined that a second set of bridge contracts would be required to ensure continuity of services and the continuance of healthcare support throughout the VA community beyond the bridge contracts  expiration on April 19, 2016.  In February 2016, the SAC awarded the second set of bridge contracts.  They are as follows:  VA119-16-D-0007, VA119-16-D-0008, VA119-16-D-0009, VA119-16-D-0010, VA119-16-D-0011, VA119-16-D-0012, and VA119-16-D-0013.  The period of performance for the second SAC bridge contracts began April 20, 2016, and will expire no later than April 19, 2017.

Leveraging the NAC s lessons learned, VHA and SAC developed a procurement strategy for a complete VA-wide MSPV formulary of approved supplies by April 2016.  To execute this plan, VHA and SAC formed a team in February 2015, to initiate development of the MSPV-NG formulary.  The goal of this team was to solicit and award approximately 7,000 individual line-items, identified as an optimal initial level, for the pending MSPV-NG formulary.  The team developed a streamlined approach to solicit and award these items, which involved VHA providing salient characteristics for all 7,000 line-items, and SAC awarding competitive BPAs based on those salient characteristics.  

Between April 2015 and January 2016, VHA forwarded to SAC approximately 4,400 individual procurement packages consisting of both single and multiple line-items, of which approximately 3,500 were solicited and 900 returned to VHA for inclusion in future grouping efforts.  Although SAC issued multiple Requests for Quotations (RFQs), vendor response rates averaged less than 30 percent.  Due to lack of response, SAC and VHA sought input from industry via a series of MSPV-NG Industry Days.  When queried, industry partners indicated two main problems: (1) VHA s salient characteristics were flawed and/or insufficient.  They did not appear to be based on clinical input, and often cited unnecessary manufacturer-specific features.  This prohibited timely and quality responses, or no responses at all in many cases; (2) Industry also indicated the administrative burden of providing quotes for single-item BPA awards was not cost effective enough for them to provide quotes. 

In order to obtain a better success rate, and work on completing new MSPV-NG contracts, two possible strategies were identified:  (1) VHA created supply-line commodity teams, and began seeking clinical input for the development of salient characteristics.  Additionally, logical commodity groupings were developed; and (2) moving forward, VHA s Program Management Office was to group line-items by supply-line categories, or by United Nations Standard Products and Services Codes.  Supply-line categories were found to be the most favored by industry.  In an effort to validate this, a Request for Information (RFI) was issued to industry in February 2016.  The RFI results confirmed the supply-line category approach as the most appropriate method to solicit BPAs for item inclusion in the approved formulary.  

On February 24, 2016, awards were made to four MSPV-NG distributors, with an estimated performance starting 120 days after notice to proceed.  The period of performance under these contracts are scheduled to begin on October 20, 2016.  It was anticipated the distributors would have a full-line of 7,000 competitively awarded BPA formulary line-items to populate their electronic catalogs (e-catalog).  Due to lack of vendor response, the formulary fell short of the necessary items required to complete the Prime Vendor s e-catalog.  In an attempt to resolve the shortfall identified above, numerous changes in VA s strategy for populating the formulary were considered.  This directly resulted in the need to establish additional MSPV bridge distribution contracts to ensure continuation of service.  The MSPV bridge contracts were awarded with a start date of April 20, 2016.  This included a 3-month base period of performance, and three 3-month option periods.  The final period of performance expiration date is not-to-exceed 12 months.  

4.  Description of Supplies/Services:  The MSPV-NG formulary will consist of two tiers:  1) the 1,600 line items previously competed by the SAC and NAC, which is being automatically populated into the MSPV-NG formulary and estimated to be ready for use by October 20, 2016; and 2) the additional VA FSS items identified by VHA to be procured under this LSJ.  This group includes various types of medical equipment and supplies distributed by FEDCO, LLC.  Examples of items covered under this category include various types of cannulas, airways, tubes and accessoriesÂ all styles, types and sizes, except those relating to blood transfusion and IV apparatus; urine and specimen collection products, urinary catheters, orthopedic/surgical supports, cervical collars, binders/suspensory, lifts, patient equipment for hospital and home use; transportation units (stretchers) patient, medical only; and light, surgical, ceiling and surgical stand.
The full list of item(s) covered under this LSJ is/are as follows: 

Part Number
Item Description
Estimated Quantity 
2006001
PART PATIENT MOBILE LIFT SLINGBAR HOOK W/MOUNTING SCREWS F/LIKO GOLVO
4262

The reprieve offered by this LSJ will allow VHA to continue placing orders under the MSPV-NG contracts on a temporary basis, and avoid an interruption in the healthcare supply chain while SAC pursues competitive procurements for the MSPV-NG formulary items.  

The proposed types of medical equipment and supplies will be ordered under the authority of this LSJ.  These items have been identified as high-use medical items vital to the successful implementation of the MSPV-NG program.  VHA analyzed the fiscal year (FY) 2015 Medical Products Data Bank, focusing on the top high-volume purchases and identified types of critical medical equipment and supplies distributed by FEDCO, LLC.  Until the MSPV-NG formulary is completed, VHA s ordering officers will be allowed to place orders for the required medical equipment and supplies.  The anticipated total value of the proposed BPA over the life of the agreement is $102,365.55.  The period of performance is not to exceed 12 months.  

5.  Statutory Authority and Supporting Rationale:  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is in accordance with FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(A), an urgent and compelling need exists, and following the procedures would result in unacceptable delays. 

6.  Rationale Supporting the Authority Cited Above:  Urgent and compelling circumstances which significantly affect the interest of the Government will not permit competition in accordance with FAR 8.405-3,  Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) . Significant adverse consequences will occur if the LSJ is not approved as the VA health care supply chain will be negatively impacted. Continuance of the MSPV Distribution Program is vital; any delay of distribution will directly impair the delivery of healthcare and services to approximately 9.5 million Veterans currently receiving care through the VA Healthcare System. A break in the health care supply chain will hinder or halt the delivery of essential medical, surgical, dental, and laboratory supplies and other contracted medical/surgical, cleaning, rescue and safety supplies and services used in the direct delivery of patient care.  

The VA Healthcare System receives approximately 40% of its medical and surgical supply support through the national MSPV Program.  Many of these items are standardized throughout the VA Healthcare System, and are a part of the formulary being developed for use in the VA. The formulary drives efficiency and familiarity in clinical practice which leads to improved patient outcomes and safety. It also decreases variation, thus reducing time to train and results in fewer errors when providing care. Standardization provides healthcare system benefits that are maximized because standardized items are interoperable. Facilities can then reinvest the savings earned into equipment and personnel that further enhance patient care.

Estimated cost reduction for purchase of individual items through the MSPV formulary is approximately $4M over the course of the twelve months proposed under this LSJ. The $4M estimate does not account for efficiencies in the ordering and inventory management processes. Overall annual inventory reduction specifically attributable to MSPV is estimated at approximately $40M.  

Disapproval of the LSJ will result in a disruption in the health care supply chain and negate these potential savings as facilities source supplies through other means.  Workload, man-hours, and cost of operations will increase as already depleting resources are lost and the agency will revert to the inefficient means of sourcing medical supplies as before the introduction of the national MSPV program in 2005.  Those inefficient methods include use of purchase cards and local VHA contracting.  

Use of purchase cards as an ordering method has shown to be more than 5 times the workload burden of using the delivery order method under the MSPV program.  In addition, there is approximately 2000 contracting staff in VHA, processing 576,134 formal contracting actions annually.  If the MSPV Ordering Officers were unable to place orders via MSPV, and those transactions were added to the workload of an already overburdened contracting staff, the result would be catastrophic.  

Lead times to procure these items through contracting for other than emergency orders are 45 days; emergency orders require action within three days.  All orders would become emergencies to ensure timely delivery of healthcare to Veterans.  C canceled surgeries due to lengthy supply lead times would possibly become the norm, and thus, adversely affecting timely access to care.  Items critical to provide immediate care will be jeopardized, and will directly impact the safety and lives of Veterans.  

VA has a critical role in the comprehensive emergency response to support local, regional, or national emergencies or disasters.  VA is charged with the delivery and coordination of support missions for VA facilities affected by disasters,Â and also performs missions assigned to VA by FEMA orÂ US Dept. of Health & Human ServicesÂ for response to and recoveryÂ from nationally-declared emergencies and disasters.Â  The Prime Vendor Program is critical to ensure VA provides a full range of support to healthcare facilities to ensure resiliency, continuity and rapid recovery of healthcare services during disasters and other potentialÂ disruptions to healthcare service delivery.  VAMCs and other select Federal facilities are designated Federal Emergency Medical Facilities with significant contingency and emergency response roles.  Accordingly, the MSPVs provide emergency supply support during major catastrophic events.  Any interruption in the health care supply chain significantly jeopardizes the ability of VA to ensure minimum disruption to delivery of critical services in a contingency situation. This would directly impact healthcare delivery to our nation s Veterans.

Other alternatives were considered, including using both the legacy bridge contracts, and the MSPV-NG contract concurrently until all of the required items can be competitively awarded.  The confusion this would create in the field is insurmountable, as field staff will face the uncertainty of which contracts to use and when.   A well-coordinated supply chain is necessary to ensure facilities are supported, and Veterans are cared for timely.  There are no reasonable alternatives that would adequately address the circumstances presented. Any financial costs incurred by the Government to execute the BPAs under the authority of the LSJ, and any potential costs or cost avoidance not realized through competition would not outweigh the benefits received through continuance of the health care supply chain. Approval of the LSJ is in the best interests of the Government and is justified by the urgency of the circumstances. 

The cost to the Government if the LSJ is not approved would not be primarily financial, although it is significant. The non-monetary costs of the health, welfare and safety of millions of Veterans cannot be quantified.  Every effort was made to compare these costs, benefits and other options; the VA cannot rationally find any other reasonable or timely alternative.

VA considered the cost to the integrity of the procurement system and VA acknowledges the importance of protecting the integrity of the procurement system. However, VA feels this is an extraordinary situation, and maintains that due to an already constricted schedule, and the significant impact of these BPAs on the delivery of medical and surgical supplies and services to millions of Veterans, the facts of this case justify the unusual measure proposed under this LSJ.  VA considered the balance of the integrity of the procurement system, and the interest of the Government and determined that the issuance of the BPAs under the authority of this LSJ is mitigated and justified.  A break in the health care supply chain will be costly and detrimentally disruptive to VA operations and delivery of critical healthcare services to 9.5 million Veterans. Items procured under the authority of this LSJ will be included in the MSPV supply chain for a maximum period of twelve months until the item can be competitively awarded.  At such time the item will be removed from the supply chain and replaced with the competitively awarded functional equivalent.

This action is vital to support VA s nationwide healthcare system and prevent disruptions to Veteran care.  The identified medical items represent supplies collectively determined essential by VHA medical centers to meet VA patient care needs.  Continued use of these products and source of supply will ensure timely delivery and minimize VA supply chain interruptions.  The vendor for these items was selected through use of data analytics tools and the Medical Product Data Bank (MedPDB).  

The MSPV-NG program is the primary means to obtain medical supplies; these items are regarded as critical to patient care.  These items are currently available under the legacy MSPV contracts.  Failure to make them available under MSPV-NG would have catastrophic effects on the field s ability to support medical centers.  Each item would have to be purchased individually either via purchase card, or through local VHA Contracting Offices, with lead times of up to 45 days.  VHA Logistics and Contracting do not have the capacity to meet the constant throughput of high cost/high volume daily individual orders required to meet clinical care needs.  Bottlenecks resulting from capacity issues would result in insufficient inventory to meet critical needs for Veteran patients, and will have a significant patient safety impact.  It is imperative that VA transition from the present way of doing business under the current MSPV program to the new and revised mandatory MSPV-NG program.  In executing this change the following improvements will be realized:

The MSPV-NG distributors shall not ship any medical/surgical or any other supplies that are not on the Government-provided MSPV-NG formulary of approved medical/surgical supplies.
The MSPV-NG distributors shall not charge any VA formulary approved suppliers to handle their product in conjunction with the contract.
The Government mandates all distributors to be Electronic Data Interchange compliant and it is in the BPAs/contracts. 
The MSPV-NG distributors shall not require product suppliers to carry liability insurance in excess of $1,000,000, charge tracking fees, and/or require additional discounts from product suppliers.
 
7.  Efforts to Obtain Competition:  MSPV-NG distribution contracts were awarded on February 24, 2016, and performance is scheduled to begin on October 20, 2016.  The MSPV-NG distributors require VA s formulary in order to fulfill the medical requirements at VA hospitals and clinics.  As stated previously, the Government intends to compete all line items within the next 12 months.  Market research shows there is adequate competition in support of the new requirements.  In accordance with FAR 5.301 and 8.405-6(a)(2), these actions will be synopsized on Federal Business Opportunities Page (FBO).  

8.  Determination of Best Value:  In accordance with FAR Subpart 8.404(d), the prices for supplies offered on FSS have already been determined to be fair and reasonable by NAC Contracting Officers.  Given VHA s critical need for the previously identified formulary supplies, and the short turn-around time until the MSPV-NG formulary is fully implemented, VA intends to select the lowest published FSS vendor and seek additional discounts.  To compete these items would result in unacceptable delays, and potential mission failure.  In the future, additional discounts will be sought through competition for these products as part of the transition to the MSPV-NG formulary.  

9.  Market Research:  The market research conducted for the MSPV-NG requirement showed there are multiple suppliers capable of providing medical products however; performance is required by October 2016, and VA does not have adequate resources for timely completion of the required items. VA has a need to have consistent, uninterrupted sources of supply that meets system-wide requirements without compromising direct patient care to VA medical centers and/or related facilities.  VA has a plan to compete these items and market research supports this acquisition strategy.  

10.  Any Other Facts Supporting the Justification:  SAC is currently establishing competitive single-award BPAs that are beginning to populate the MSPV-NG formulary.  Competition is on-going; however, at the onset of MSPV-NG s period of performance, the formulary will not have sufficient breadth of medical products to meet the operational needs of VA.  It is anticipated the MSPV-NG distributors will begin accepting and delivering orders on approximately October 20, 2016, for all items covered in this LSJ. 

11. Actions to Increase Competition:  As described above, VA will compete future requirements and continuously add necessary products to the MSPV-NG formulary.  SAC will work with VHA s program office to remove or overcome barriers to competition in future acquisitions.  VA has and will continue to meet with industry on a periodic basis for continued input and feedback on acquisition strategies.  All future acquisitions of MSPV-NG BPAs will be solicited and awarded in a manner that promotes competition to greatest extent practicable.
